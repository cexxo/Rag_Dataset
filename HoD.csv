Review
"After the disappointing last season of Game of Thrones, many predicted the worst for this other adaptation based on George RR Martin's novels, in this case, ''Fire and Blood''. However, not only is it a success, but in some ways, it is even superior to the original series. First of all, it is obvious that the creators of the series take their work seriously: the sets, the cinematography, the costumes and the special effects are all elements that elevate House of the Dragon to a high level of quality (the making-of of each episode are to be seen). Ramin Djawadi, a renowned composer of the GOT soundtrack, returns with even more beautiful, intense, emotional and epic pieces! Aside from the main theme common to the two series, we remember these GOT classics like ''The Rains of Castamere'', ''Winds of Winter'', ''The Tower of Joy'' as well as the music associated with Winterfell or Daenerys. From HOTD, we will remember the march of Viscerys on ''Protector of the Realm'', the coronation of Rhaenyra on ''The Crown of Jaeharys'', her marriage to Daemond or the sublime music which accompanies the intimate scene between her and Criston Cole.But more than anything, it is the acting and the quality of the writing that make the series successful. Unlike GOT, which simultaneously followed dozens of characters across Westeros and beyond, HOTD takes place approximately 300 years before Daenerys and focuses on the intrigues of the Targaryen family, from its peak to its bloody downfall caused by internal wars. Some episodes feels extremely packed as lot is going on because the first season covers a period of around thirty years. As a result, characters sometimes appear and die in the same episode while Rhaenyra, Alicent and their respective children are played by different actors to emphasize the jumps in time, which constitutes one of the rare downsides of the season because some passages move too quickly and leave the impression that we are missing information. In short, we don't always have time to digest all the intrigues. We should also highlight the unusual fact that there are four childbirth scenes during the season, each equally brutal!The strengths far outweigh the few weaknesses and make House of the Dragon the best series since... season four of Game of Thrones! I rated each episode and it gives me an overall total of 8.2/10. This is a must watch for sure!"
"I am a massive fan of the world of Westeros. My love of this world began with the original Game of Thrones TV show. I watched it, loved it, and then read all the books before the show caught up to the book's storyline and eventually went passed it. Long story short, I love the books, I kinda half hate the OG show for screwing up the conclusion so dramatically. Which is why I was not looking forward to this series when I heard it announced.I was sure it was gonna be a cash grab, cynical slog at the same quality as the final season of thrones but... I was wrong. Very wrong.This show is fantastic. Respect to those who dislike it, I'll just say that for me, this is everything I wanted and more from a show about Westeros.I love this story. I love the themes of Duty vs Freedom and the conflict between those values. I LOVE the characters and their conflicts, flaws, personal histories and motivations. I love Viserys and Daemon and Raenyra and Alicent, Otto, and Christen, and Aemond, Aegon, and all the rest. There's so many characters to enjoy and each one is compelling in their own way.Also, can we all at least recognize that this is far and away the best produced fantasy television series of all time? The sets are unbelievable, the costumes are gorgeous, the cinematography is stunning, the props, the makeup, the VFX, EVERYTHING is firing on all cylinders.My only criticisms are that the time jumps are handled somewhat clumsily in terms of casting and characters develop off screen more than they should. And I thought it was stupid when Rhaenys killed all those people in episode 9 and then didn't kill her literal enemies who imprisoned and threatened her because she ""didn't want to start something"".There are minor gripes I could flesh out, but why would I when the show offers far more in the way of enjoyable and downright addictive television?I watched every episode as they came out and plan to do the same for season 2."
A mythical kingdom where raw natures of human qualities shaping a realm. So much entangled games of politics that can keep the audience engaged without wanting to miss a beat. So much details with unique characters with many stories of their own. Flawless visuals that sets and symbolizes the background of each moment. Excellent CGI. Precise audio effects and excellent background music. Prequel is actually welcoming to the new audience and it's an opportunity to get a feel for the GOT series. Though it may sometimes strand new comers with the absence of a proper prologue HOD become interesting as the episodes goes on.
"This show wears its political messaging on its sleeve and shoves it in your face. It can be annoying at times and quite obvious what sort of message the show is pushing, but this ultimately has no effect on the quality of the show. Some of the best moments in Game of Thrones were scenes that didn't have any dialogue, a series of visuals would play accompanied by great music. As if you were looking at a series of paintings. These moments I refer to were few and far between in Game of Thrones. In House of the Dragon, these moments occur quite frequently. Strong visual storytelling with great music and great visuals, completely immersed in the visual side of this medium. Almost as if you were watching a silent film. No dialogue necessary. The acting, from the main cast at least, is strong. You can tell the actors are confident in their abilities to act and are unafraid to emote. I find confidence an important factor in good acting. The show also does a great job at conveying the character's emotions through cinematography and camera work. House of The Dragon believes in the motto of showing, not telling. If you enjoyed Game of Thrones, especially episodes such as The Winds of Winter and the episode where Jon Snow and Ramsay Bolton fight, then you will certainly enjoy this series. Don't skip out and don't let the show's politics get in the way of your enjoyment."
"All I can say is...WOW!!! What a follow up to one of the best shows ever in Game of Thrones. Like millions of others, I'm a huge Game of Thrones fan so I was counting down the days until this came out. Even though I couldn't wait to watch it I didn't have a lot of confidence it would be as good as the original because of how bad that last season of GoT was. The last season and especially the last episode were extremely disappointing. Well, House of the Dragon is making up for it because this show is beautiful. With season 2 coming out in a few weeks I've just rewatched season 1 again and it was even better the second time around. I'm now going into the new season with all the confidence in the world that it's going to be great."
"I've been looking forward to House of the Dragon since the spin-off was first announced. The majority of the reviews and ratings have been great so that only enhanced my excitement. I told myself I'd be happy if it was half as good as the original and I can say that without a doubt that it is. While it's obviously not as good as the original (not much is) it definitely is still a really good show that will no doubt be successful. It has the same Game of Thrones feel with all the action, drama, mystery, etc. People who don't like it either didn't want to because they hate everything or are comparing it to the original...don't. Just take it for what it is and that's a really good show! It was the most watched premiere in HBO history and has already been renewed for another season. This is going to have a long run so I hope it continues to get better and better like the original."
"This has to be one of the best spinoffs ever made. This is a show where you can't be playing on your phone, cooking dinner or doing something else, it requires your undivided attention. It's a show that never gets stale. I can't remember ever being bored, even for one episode. I loved every second of every episode and I think you will to if you give it a chance. The one thing I didn't like was the time jump came to early. I would've liked to seen more of the earlier episode years. I've already watched this show twice from beginning to end. The new season should be here sometime this summer and I'm sure it'll be just as good as the first."
"I don't even know how to describe how much I loved House of Dragon. First of all, Game of Thrones is my favorite show of all time. I love it so much I've watched it all the way through several times and will again. I was hoping House of Dragon would be half as good. Well, it's more than that. It's not quite as good as Game of Thrones, it's pretty close. It's definitely the best new show that's come out in a while. I'm glad it was nominated for a few Emmy's including best drama, it didn't win but glad to see the show is getting the love it deserves. The entire cast is unbelievable, not a bad actor on the entire show."
"The first few episodes were quite promising. I thought the initial cast was interesting. Especially Paddy Considine (the king) surprised me on how well he could carry the role. Milly Alcock was intriguing as well as Rhaenyra, the princess.And then episode 6 happened. A 10 year jump with randomly some ""older"" cast, mixed with the same actors, nearly not aged at all.From that point on I lost interest. Emma D'Arcy couldn't deliver as the older Rhaenyra and some of the other new cast also felt like a downgrade.Not just that, It's also the moment that, considering such a long timespan the story takes place, you start to notice how one-dimensional the show Is. It becomes a bit soapy. GoT had a surplus in races, traits and storylines going on, all in a somewhat chaotic but inspiring cocktail to build up suspense and intrigue.This still has the look and feel, but not the content.It had a few highlights after that which made me somewhat come back to It, but I'm not super impressed. I hoped on a bit more, maybe not to the epic level as GoT, but a bit closer to It. I don't know what to think of It actually. The keyword that seems to come up is mostly ""whatever"". I guess, that's how I feel after watching this: a whatever show."
"The House Of Dragon Is An Extremely Underrated Show, Which Can Never Be Apprised To The Greatness It Has Achieved. The Show Just Gives The R. R Martin Books, The Level It Was Never Seen Before. It Just Pushes The Limits R. R Or The Directors And Producers Of GOT Couldn't Do Or Could Never Have Achieved. Milly Has Done Has Exceptional Job Has Young Talented Actress To Do Justice To Such A Huge Role Of Rhaenyra Targaryen, The Dragon Queen. The Role Just Suits Perfectly Into Her Shoes. Emma Did Let The Benchmark Set Milly Go Down As Well. She Just Took The Role To New Heights. The Shows Gives More Freighting Aspects The Targaryen's Offer, Fire & Blood. The Show Completely Sums Up There House Motto. A Brutal Masterpiece."
"GoT not only was beautifully shot. With wonderful acting and compelling characters but it was also complex. This show feels like its just trying to rush through some plot. GoT had multiple characters that you felt deeply for, both loving and hating. None of these characters have deep substance. Additionally we aren't following the grand and unique stories of several characters and anxiously awaiting to see how they collide. We are watching a single plot seem to race towards the end. This is visually beautiful but there is no emotional connection beyond hoping to see a glimpse of the connection to GoT.I'm very disappointed and I hope that next time a spinoff is made they take their time crafting the characters and the plot and less time pandering to the perceived desires of the audience."
"Some reviewers have claimed that I shouldn't compare it to GOT, but how can I not ? After all, it wouldn't have been here if not for GOT.And while the first couple of episodes didn't exactly impress me, I decided to watch the whole season before judging it. I mean, giving it the chance to develop the characters, it was bound to get better, right ?Wrong ! It didn't !The crew in charge of lighting must have gone on strike, cause most of the season played out in semi darkness, and it also seemed like most of the episodes had plot for about 30 minutes of time, which caused scenes to be dragged out painfully, and supplied with fillers like 10 minutes of soft porn in #4, and 10 minutes of people dancing in #5.And then there was the time jumps. The season spanned about 20 years, so we were treated to a lot of changing actors, but oddly enough some characters didn't seem to age at all. Otto, Daemon, Rhaenys and Criston looked pretty much like they did at the beginning of the season. I guess the makeup crew was too busy turning Viserys into a crypt keeper lookalike, to do something about that.As for the acting, I'm not gonna comment on that, since the lack of character build gave the actors very little to work with. That also meant that whenever somebody was killed, I was mostly like ""right, so that happened"", because they hadn't build up the character enough for anyone to care.If they wanted to make a spin off, from a popular show, they could at least have tried to maintain just a bit of the quality of the original, but this was just a very sloppy production way below what we have come to expect from HBO.The dragons looked great though :)"
"""House of the Dragon"" reignites the fire of Westeros with a thrilling first season. From the opening moments, the show masterfully transports us back into the world of political backstabbing, noble houses, and the majestic power of dragons.The Targaryen family takes center stage, showcasing complex characters whose decisions will shape the fate of the realm. Expect intricate relationships, power struggles, and stunning betrayals that will keep you hooked until the very last episode.Visually stunning and emotionally charged, ""House of the Dragon"" delivers epic battles, shocking twists, and heart-wrenching moments. While there are time jumps that might initially feel jarring, the show ultimately delivers a gripping narrative that cements itself as a worthy successor to ""Game of Thrones.""If you loved the intrigue, ambition, and spectacle of ""Game of Thrones"", then ""House of the Dragon"" is a must-watch. It's a captivating return to Westeros filled with fire, fury, and the promise of a devastating war to come."
"The series seems to be the most influential derivative in the world, and its concepts combined and integrated in the writing seem unusually strong, and the application of events, the course of events, and the political escalation are unparalleled, and the CGI was very beautiful, and in episode 2 it was a review of the CGI, photography, and the series HOUSE OF THE DRAGON. It literally revived the hope and passion of everyone who was disappointed by the end of Game of Thrones. HOUSE OF THE DRAGON is more than a derivative series. It is a revival of the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. I give it a rating of 10/10 because it deserves that."
"The issue with House of the Dragon is that it just isn't interesting. Game of Thrones had so much political intrigue that the audience paid attention to every single detail. There was always a massive payoff with some seriously shocking events. The seasons (prior to 8) had interesting and complex story lines.With House of the Dragon, this is not quite the case. Where is the political intrigue? Where is the conflict? A plot centered around a daughter's refusal to marry/being a female heir is not interesting enough to be the sole plot for four episodes. There needs to be additional conflict. I will keep watching and praying that it gets more interesting. If this is a slow burn, it is VERY slow."
"The tables turned towards the end of the first season, in comparison like all always the house of dragons doesn't even come close as to what the game of thrones was, in fact and reasoning there was no need to even compare with both plots and characters likewise was in their own league power struggles through the ages but in some cases accidents do sure play a larger role as to the ignition of what's about come, setting the stage for an inevitable war between love,blood and power let the outcome be favorable to both the victor and the one who lost the war cause in the end we've heard the song of ice and fire but not of blood and fire, lett the raging flame burn."
"A couple of episodes in, I'm struggling to remain interested. It's a lot like Game of Thrones S6/S7; it's a competent production, but it lacks a lot of the intrigue, wit and humor of the first four seasons of that series.It's also increasingly clear that Martin has a few tropes he comes back to again and again, and House of the Dragon feels like a rehash with fewer stakes, a smaller variety of characters, and less interesting personal stories. He doesn't seem to have much to say, no big idea that shines through in the narrative, and he thus seems stuck in describing one cycle of violence after another. This series has made it quite obvious why he is unable to finish his books, and why he left HBO to fend for itself in wrapping up Game of Thrones. His shtick was fun the first time, but it's not particularly thoughtful or interesting and thus makes for a pretty mediocre second showing.One notable miss on the production side is the music. It's such a big step back that it was surprising to learn Ramin Djawadi is also behind this series' score. It's nowhere near as compelling or interesting as his music for GoT, where it was a big part of the presentation and was rightly recognized as such with various awards.The actors can't be blamed for their characters, and they all seemed to do fine. Paddy Considine as Viserys makes for a compelling cautious king, and every scene with Eve Best as Rhaenys is better for having her in it.All in all, House of the Dragon doesn't come close to the first four seasons of Game of Thrones. But neither did the second half of that series, so I suppose it's not a huge surprise. Given the struggles of similar competing American fantasy series like Wheel of Time, The Witcher, and Rings of Power it might be a while yet before we get a truly next generation big fantasy series."
"What was best about GOT was the character development and complexity: viewing a character's motivations through their history and experience, the character arc, the character's evolution. HOTD writers evidently confuse inconsistency with complexity. None of the characters are terribly interesting. They don't exist in any kind of world that's presented. There is no realm. We see mostly claustrophobic scenes of bickering families, like in a soap opera, except with some anonymous knights standing around, and occasional graphic violence.And the banal, predictable dialogue: ""That's your father talking"", ""My father's dead and he chose me as his successor"". What I wouldn't give for a Littlefinger rapier monologue.Scenes that should create tension and suspense, like when they're looking for Aegon to be crowned, don't, because- who the heck is Aegon? Just a name of a character we don't care about because he's not formed.Too bad because first episode seemed promising; strong independent young woman becomes a leader. But then turns into promiscuous mother fighting another mother over whose kids gets what. Never clear what difference it makes who is in charge. They all seem kind of the same.Just rewatch seasons 1-4 GOT."
"The amount of ppl who gave this show a very low rating it absolutely blows my mind! I wonder if they saw the whole season or just an episode and for whatever reason they decided the show is a failure.I was so sad when GOT ended and I was sure that I will never again get to see another one like it. Till House of the Dragon came along. I watched the whole season in one night, I literally didn't sleep because I couldn't stop watching. Finished season 1 and realized that season 2 is not out yet 🤦‍♀️. I have to wait till June omg nooooo"
"I'm not going to talk about the plot, acting, dragons, scenes...anything. I'm just saying if you loved GOT you will love this one as well."
"I really enjoyed this backstory series, rich characters. So much opportunity to expand the histories of GOT characters. I would love to see someone like James Spader make an appearance. Every episode is such a feast for the eyes, making one homesick for a place you've never been. Although it is not without its cliches of forbidden love, scheming relatives and the like, it doesn't hurt to have dragons and Rhys Ifans to soften the blow. I don't usually like a spin off, they are often disappointing and lacking, but House of the Dragon had me hooked from the first episode. Even the into draws you in."
"Ok so I've seen a lot of excitement about House of the Dragon. Everybody seems to be enthralled with this new flame breathing hype, and I am to, to an extent. But it feels like there are several faults with the series which just seem to be overlooked. I believe many fans are blinded by their love for the original show. House of the Dragon and Game of Thrones, or HotD and GoT as I will now be referring to them from here on out, have two very different ways to progress the story and plot forward. HotD feels like it has to throw in so much unnecessary filler. This is the problem with trying to adapt The Dance of the Dragons into a show format. There is way too much nothing happening until the king finally dies and the war starts. You can't spend 5 episodes getting to know Rhaenyra as a teenager, then jump forward to when she is in her 20s, and then again when she is in her 30s before you actually start the main story. It works in the books because there, it is told from a historical point of view, not something happening in real time. HotD season 1 really does feel like a 10 hour long prologue, which is crazy considering that it even started with a prologue.GoT season 1 on the other hand slowly but surely introduced the viewer to the world through how the characters behaved and interacted with one another. While at the same time faithfully adapting the source material from the books. But the show also added fenomenal original scenes which we would never be able to get in the books. A perfect example of this is the ""War Stories"" scene where King Robert Baratheon (played by Mark Addy), Barristan Selmy (played by Ian McElhinney) and Jaime Lannister (played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) each recount their first kill. Meanwhile in HotD we get half an episode of the king Viserys (played by Paddy Considine) hunting a white stag as new original content to fill in the blanks. Now am I saying there aren't good scenes in HotD? No, there definitely are. But there is too much filler for it to feel like anything else but filler, not the ""calm before the storm"" feeling they're going for.The deer hunt also nicely transitions into my other major point. HotD always feels the need to clarify things which simply don't require clarification. When prince Aegon is celebrating his second birthday, king Viserys holds his infamous white stag hunt in the prince's honor, this is seen as a sign by many due to the white stag being seen as a symbol of the monarchy. Yet they never find the animal, so Viserys instead opts to skewer a regular brown stag. But right before everyone heads home, the white stag shows itself to princess Rhaenyra, really beating in the fact that Rhaenyra is Viserys' rightful heir like a hammer to the viewer's skull. This is simply not needed. We don't need to be told that Rhaenyra's the true successor, anyone watching could've told you that.HotD outright tells you Rhaenyra's sons are not Laenor's instead of leaving it ambiguous. Why tell us this? It really doesn't matter if they're bastards or not, the only thing that matters is if people think they are bastards or not. Because if they are bastards but everyone thinks they're legitimate then Rhaenyra is fine, but if they are legitimate but everyone thinks they're bastards then Rhaenyra is in a terrible spot. The series also introduced the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" as a prophecy that Aegon the Conqueror only conquered the seven kingdoms to unify them against the coming night. This is a popular fan theory but it never needed to be confirmed. It is kind of insulting that HotD can't go a single episode without treating its viewers as 10-year olds who can't think for themselves. I'm also personally not a fan of how they made the Valyrian steel dagger that was first used in the assassination attempt on Bran in GoT and then the knife that Arya used to kill the Night King to some massive heirloom tracing all the way back to Aegon the Conqueror.I also think the cast of HotD is really lacking. GoT had one of the most colorful and diverse cast of characters I've seen in a television series aside from something completely colossal such as One Piece. In HotD I don't really have a favorite character, not because I hate all of them, but more so because the vast majority of people in the show are so bland and basic. Daemon Targaryen (played by Matt Smith) is cool sometimes but most of the time he's just an edgelord who always does the most morally questionable thing possible to impress Rhaenyra and annoy his enemies. This however becomes very predictable after a time and he too, fades into the background. Prince Aemond ""One-Eye"" (played by Ewan Mitchell) is also definitely a likable asshole type character, but he just isn't around enough. I've seen some call it a Soap Opera with dragons and I'm ashamed to say I agree.I do not hate the show. It is visually stunning at times and the dragons at least look cool, although the show majorly screwed up the scaling for the dragons. Pretty much every dragon in the show is the same size even though some are vastly older then others, aside from Vhagar who must have been fed a unique diet of whale-class growth hormones and elephant steroids.I am fairly certain that when season 2 comes out there's going to be an even more massive wave of praise for the show now that The Dance of the Dragons has well and truly started. But I feel like a lot could've been done to improve its opening. I will watch season 2, but not with any big expectations."
"I was hoping to go the rest of my life without ever seeing another jousting match or brothel scene. But there were both in just the first episode. I think that's been done before!? I found the start of this new story to be boring, routine and not very original. I hope it picks up."
"House of the Dragon, but is it any good, or is it just something people watch so they have something to talk about?Its not very good. The show struggles, and the actors seem to lack confidence, with very few strong performances. It carries the vibe of one of those cheap British soap operas, only without the drama. Weak acting, dull dialogue, and some poor direction.In the opening episode, a noble and his guard commit atrocities in a town square, in the final shot the noble raises his longsword intending to kill a man who is being held down by foot soldiers. The trouble is that had the sword actually swung as it did, it would have also likely removed the arms of both men holding the victim in place, but the next shot shows a severed head. This struck me as careless direction, and frankly that attitude permeates throughout the show. The actors seem to either lack range or they are on auto pilot, assured that the show is already a success on the back of its name. Which seems to actually be true if one looks at the many gushing reviews.I found it to be dull and lacklustre, certainly not worthy of the press it gets online. Struggled to finish the first episode. The original show also started slow but soon found its footing after a few episodes, particularly with the death of Ned Starck, it's possible that this show will also grow into itself, but it does not look promising, especially since there are few secrets about the world after the first series - such as the white walkers ect.A disappointment. 5 stars."
"I really really enjoyed this show and loved all the lore we got. The actors were, in my opinion, cast really well and did a great job. However, I think the big time jumps lost were not the way to go. It distanced me a lot from the characters and any events I was expecting in my head. At first the forbidden and more or less secret admiration between Rhaenyra and Daemon is such a big thing and we get Rhaenyra being extra bold when asking Daemon to take her to Dragonstone and then suddenly we skip ten years. Oh and then suddenly they are married with kids. I really really would have loved to see their relationship develop further and what others think of it and the wedding and and and... time to read some fix-it fan fiction I guess."
"Season 1: The first season of 'House Of The Dragon (2022-)' is definitely up there with the best seasons of 'Game Of Thrones (2011 - 2019)'. Asserting its dominance early on, the show details the consequences of the peaceful Targaryen King's decision to name his first-born daughter heir to the iron throne - consequences which only become more complex after he later sires a son (who, according to tradition, should supplant his older sister). The core of the narrative is based around political intrigue, with the various players plotting to give the throne to whoever's ascension would benefit themselves the most. The backstabbing, betrayal, heel-turns and revelations are all incredibly compelling, and the show manages to weave a tight-knit tapestry out of its various factions and conflicts. It's in some ways more focused than its older brother, focusing entirely around a decades-long issue of succession and more-or-less bouncing between two primary characters (although it takes a while for the pieces to all fall into place). There's still plenty of intrigue to be found, though, and the narrative twists and turns many times. It remains wholly engaging throughout, even as it navigates several hefty time-jumps and even recasts its core characters. It's really well-executed, a mature and impeccably written affair from start to finish. It also looks amazing, with immersive costuming and set-design and tactile special effects (the dragons look fantastic). The acting is all great, too, with the stand-out being the phenomenal Paddy Considine - although Olivia Cooke, Emma D'Arcy, Millie Alcock, Emily Carey, Matt Smith, Rhys Ifans and Eve Best are all notably strong as well. It's all just really entertaining, an often jaw-dropping and delightfully frustrating experience that puts you on the edge of your seat and keeps you there. It also features some palpable character arcs and is surprisingly affecting on occasion. It's just a brilliant series overall, even though it does have a few slower episodes (which thankfully tend to have great endings). It also leaves you wanting more, much more, so it's a good thing that season 2 isn't far away. I watched 'Game Of Thrones (2011 - 2019)' after it had all been released, so I didn't experience the wait between seasons which I'll now have to with this show. Honestly, I just can't wait until it returns. I hope that it continues to be as good as this. Incredible stuff."
(To the first season)
"It has a promising story, a lot of money and an interesting epoch to talk about. It starts really good, but suddenly jumps a lot of years with no notice, and later a lot of years more.What was disgusting to me was the acting: the youngest stars take a fresh view of the character, while the older ones just cry, and cry, and cry.They've only 2 faces: brave (as they're going to war) or crying because they've lost something.I just hope that this doesn't become to a simple hight budget soap opera. While I saw the previous series from the very first chapter, this one is becoming tedious to follow. And worst of all, you know what will happen.Really they couldn't do something bigger with this rich world? Really?"
"For me this is on par with game of thrones or in other words on the same level as 1 or 2 seasons of it. Meaning in my book, it's close to a 10/10 but for me is a 9.5/10 cause I feel as if the start was a bit slow but that does not mean it did not exceed expectations after a few episodes. The story was very well written & it's definitely one of the strongest spin off shows of any recent universe/series. The ending got me gassed for the new season & makes me wonder what we'll get in the future in the game of thrones universe. The acting was phenomenal & each character just like game of thrones, although some were annoying as hell, they were great characters. The time jumps weren't even confusing either. Seeing more & more dragons was cool asf too, can't wait for season 2. I fw this show heavy I'll be so real."
"The show contains all the necessary elements of a great show: suspense, drama, betrayal, passion - however it's biggest flaw is that it lacks a likable person.Every character falls in either of two categories; arrogant or pathetic, and this becomes apparent immediately.The show needs a hero with humility whose rise to power is mostly seen as a taking of responsibility for the good of the realm and not for one's personal ambition.Where is the character development? Where is the struggle? What sort of values should we emulate and from whom?Still, the show is worth watching - I just hope that one of the dragons goes crazy and eats everyone.Ugh, where is Jon Snow when you need him?"
Carrying the nostalgia of Game of thrones into this and comparing everything with the original...i would say this looks pretty awesome and you get the feel of watching original game of thrones... its the same but different characters...Hope we will fall in love with them as the season progresses.... A good ist episode..
"I'm four episodes in and I can say I don't feel strongly about this show. I was huge fan of GoT, but disappointed with the way it ended, so I was not really excited when they announced this show.So far, it hasn't been that great. This takes place about 170ish years before the events of GoT, so we see what a Targaryean ruled Westeros is like. The plot so far heavily revolves around a looming war of succession between multiple Targaryeans. It's basically a soap opera, with a lot of double dealing and backstabbing going on.One thing that really annoyed me was that they try to link it the original series by connecting the Targaryean rule to the prophecy in GoT. This makes little sense, and was clearly done as a cheap tie-in with little thought behind it. The worst part is, it's just a painful reminder of the way GoT ended, and how disappointing the whole ""prophecy"" thing was (not to mention a red herring) and how underwhelming the white walker invasion was after years of build up.That brings me to my final complaint, in that there's no real compelling antagonists or protagonists here. We have a bunch of unlikeable characters vying for the throne, but all of them are pretty horrible. There's no Jon Snow or Tyrion Lannister, and after episode 4, it looks like Rhaenrys has more in common to Cersei than Daenerys. There is no one to root for, and no existential threat beyond the wall or from anywhere else. It's just palace intrigues and plots within plots.Enjoyable for those like soap operas, with a little T&A and some brutal violence, with the occassional dragon thrown in. High production value for sure, and the end of episode three had a pretty cool battle scene. But this isn't the type of show you get obsessed with like GoT was."
"Literally my first review I've left on IMDB and I'm left wondering who on earth is rating this so highly?I absolutely love the world of Westeros and the adaption of Fire & Ice to TV. It was done superbly right up to the final season.This however is utter garbage and I predict it'll be in the bin after a second season.The cast is bland, boring, lacking charisma and intrigue. After 4 episodes and spending the best part of that in a castle council chamber or weirwood tree I'm done. One of the best characters in those 4 episodes is Damon dragon.4 hours banging on about monarchist sentimentality is enough for me and this from a person who loves and highly rates The Crown.Dreadful, absolutely dreadful from HBO!"
"Although it is not as breathtaking as GOT, this is one of the best series that I have ever seen. You can watch it for your weekend or when you are beside your girlfriend to spend time. Not only is it historical, but also it is action in some ways.When you are watching HOUSE OF DRAGONS you find a strong sense between this and GOT in light of same music and more important same writer. I believe that like Got you lost time while watching episodes because of strong scenarios. So it has the nature of GOT.I believe that it is best because the scenario is fantastic and there are no weakness at the episodes. It has the nature of GOT that is chaos so during watching the movie you should expect something happen. It includes all of the aspects like love, chit and etc.I recommend this because when you finish this movie you are surprised and say , oh my god this is unbelievable. Although it is a fiction series, it will tie with your soul. So you can not forget the end of the episode.All in all, THE HOUSE OF DROGN is a good choice to spend your time with your bestie or alone. What I believe is that fans of GOT should follow this movie."
"If you stop watching shows through garbage streaming services with low bit rate. Just annoys me to see reviews criticizing the cinematography because they can't see in dark scenes when it has absolutely nothing to do with the cinematography and everything to do with max streaming. Watch the Christopher Nolan video of him talking about blu ray discs. Streaming services butcher the quality. With a blu ray disc they can control everything so you're seeing the media the way the director intended. Streaming changes the color and sound and one of the down sides of low bit rate that most streaming services use, is muddy shadows, so in dark scenes, the quality just go to crap. On a blu ray all detail is retained in dark scenes.Streaming is trash, physical media should make a come back. Add up how much you're paying for streaming now days and it can easily turn out to be over $100 a month, and how much content do you even consume? 1 show a few movies a month? You could purchase and actually OWN all that content in superior blu ray quality for less. It can never be taken from you, can never be edited or altered in any way, it's a permanent Netflix library consisting of only things you want to watch on your shelf."
"I get the exuberance of 10 star reviews and the excitement of being back in Westeros. But it was already apparent in first few episodes that the cast wasn't going to be able to live up to the charisma of it's predecessor . The slow pacing would not be as big an issue if we had a more interesting cast to watch. And to make things worse, just as I was starting to get used to all the new faces, they do the most weirdest RECAST mid season. Reshuffling the most important characters of the series. It didn't work in the Crown. And it feels every bit like a switch and bait for the worst. I have not felt this disappointed in a show , since the brutal dismemberment of key cast in the Walking Dead. Only here there is none left to look forward to .A note to HBO, the weird time jump didn't need a recast at all. A 22 year old actress playing the role of a younger 16 year old princess and an older 26 year old version of her self , is not that big of a stretch. Just change her hair style and add some wrinkles. Put the show on pause for two years, anything but this."
"Everyone please stop review bombing the show! Just three days ago I saw the same thing happening with She Hulk and now House of The Dragon?! Don't develop hate before even watching it and stop giving one star reviews. Just don't judge it on the basis of the ending of Game of Thrones and watch first!When House of The Dragon was first announced,I had doubts as to whether it would be good. But as more and more trailers came out,they got me excited.And then I saw the first episode,and it was an amazing way to start the series!It does a pretty good job of introducing the characters!The acting, cinematography and CGI are all amazing! The dragons look very realistic.I hope that it gets better and better with every episode and become one of the greatest shows of all time because it has the potential.Will add updates as more episodes come out every week."
"Game of Thrones was special. It had families from all over a fantasy world. The families had likeable characters who you routed for. It had the wall, the nights watch, dragons, and MAGIC to top it all. Each character was interesting and then the show really took off when the character's storylines started to intertwine.House of the Dragon, simply has dragons. I'm not sure who to route for, it's almost a show made up of villains. Maybe that's the point? Either way, where is the magic? One house is not enough to make me look forward to future seasons. The show is really well made, and it's fun to watch, but in the end it's kind of forgettable. This show is good, but not special."
"I have seen the first three episodes, and as a GOT fan I am pretty disappointed. There are three main reasons I think:"
"-The lack of humor. In Game of Thrones the humor (mainly sarcastic) is a fundamental aspect of the narrative. It seems lame without it.-The characters. It might be connected to the above, but it seems to me, that almost none of the characters has the ""charisma"" and complexity to make them interesting. Rhaenyra and her uncle may be the exceptions.-The drama. In GOT the complex characters and relations combined with the simple concept of the pursuit of power, creates a lot of interesting scheming over time. In House of the Dragons the scheming begins before we even get to know the characters (really get to know them!), and the consequence is that I don't really care..."
"House of Dragons is a political drama with characters who are all flawed and you can reflect with them much easier because you feel like they are more human than in almost any other movie. They are not all perfect men and women, main characters have flaws that will make you question if you agree with them or not. Very rarely you can feel this way in any other movie or a tv show. When you watch you feel that this is not a perfect main character driven movie. Its a movie with people who are all with their problems and mistakes they make. It really feels like you are watching a real political divide within a family not some good vs evil thing.Everything is great, except CGI! Who drew these dragons? Third graders in Chinese sweatshops? This was the worst undeserved CGI i ever seen in film. As soon dragons came on screen you want to cringe in disbelief how bad it looks."
"House of The Dragon contains the same exact thrill that Game Of Thrones captured for so many seasons. It is gorey, violent, brutal, and very well written. HBO rebounds very well."
"The reason Game of Thrones, both the book and the first series had people across the world hooked was not dragons (because there were none in season 1) - it was not enormous battles (because there were none in season 1)It was because an extremely intriguing cast of characters, with dynamic backgrounds, clear and concise motivations (or mysterious and elusive ones) played off of each other in dialogue and in contrast. Scenes such as Varys and Littlefinger discussing the succession in the first episode. Tyrion and Jamie jesting about their father. Polticking that gave meat to a world we didn't understand, but quickly wanted to understand.The opening sequence gave us a map that showed us from where our characters came and played on the great houses.House of the Dragon assumes because the Targaryens are Targaryens we care about them. The varying houses are all well established, Otto Hightower is a secretive and despicable man... but why? Who is he? Why is he the kings hand? Who is he to the king? These are questions the Game of thrones initial episodes gave us for characters like Ned and his relationship to the baratheons. We understood why Robert Baratheon gave little care to Cersei, because in the opening minutes we see his obsession for Lyanna.House of the Dragon has failed in its three episodes to explain anything of meaning about Daemon, Rhaenyra, her father, his Hand, his wife...They are still pretty faces with no backstory, and there is a grand difference between lack of backstory and crafting mystery. One conceals an absence of depth and the other implies there is depth whilst revealing it along the way, piece by piece. So far these characters feel like generic substitutes who happen to carry the last names of characters we once adored.I hope, because I love the work of Miguel and George and the team at HBO, that they have crafted something of far more substance than has currently been shown to us!"
"Here after watching today's finale of season 1. Wow gotta say what a wild ride it was. I haven't watched a good television in years. The whole plot is even million times ahead of season 1 of GOT. Writing of even conversation scenes are so well written, characters being three dimensional and their well defined motivations, amazing soundtrack specially in last 2 episodes. Loved paddy as viserys, his acting was so good and how he portraed an old man who was just there to keep the realm in peace. His last day specially was so sad but badass at the same time. Loved daemon, some people didn't like too much time skip but I thought it was handled really well and hats off to the casting team too because it remained consistent throughout show. Everyone played their part well, miley was good as young rheneyrya and although I was hesitant watching emmy, she also knocked ball out of park as older rheneyrya. The stakes that were building towards the end of the episode where they showed to let the dance of the dragon begin gave goosebumps. Please bring these same showrunners and crew for season 2 as well because I couldn't find a single problem out of this show. Honorable mentions of other great characters are otto hightower, alicent, aegon, aemond, rheyneys, coryles. I never thought I would like to watch any show after GOT and I was more interested toward the long night show which was cancelled but I'm glad this show was made and I'm truly excited to watch next season probably coming around 2024."
"Director of photography messed it up, all scenes at night have no backlights or highlights. In every night scenes you can't see anything at all. It's so annoying trying to figure it out what the heck is happening. I watched the season in HBO MAX not a ripped copy or something. I thought it was and issue with my TV BUT NO. I tested Two TVs at home, a laptop and a smartphone, none worked. So that's the way it is. Dark scenes where you have to imagine what are doing the characters. Same in castle interiors. I wonder if episodes had quality control before broadcasting. It's really disappointing. Good series, appalling photography."
"Last week, I binged seasons 1-7 of GoT so those episodes are still very fresh in my mind and I am unaffected by rose tinted nostalgia.I've just watched episode 1 of House of the Dragon.How can I sum it up? So far, so good.The music is sufficiently different to be fresh while remaining recognizable. The production quality and cinematography are as expected - fantastic, epic and awe inspiring, aside from a couple of excessively dark scenes that were over and done with very quickly.There is gore aplenty. Nudity, vomit, sex and depravity. Incidental background humor. A promise of things to come.The casting seems to be on point - I saw no issue with any of the characters, and the leads were well chosen for their roles.The writing seems to be up to par. As an introduction, this episode was written and directed well. I want to see and know more - a good sign.So far I'm pleased with this return to the land of Westeros. Valar morghulis!"
If you're looking to satisfy your GOT itch then this probably isn't what you're looking for. Now if you want a soap opera with a few dragons then this is it.Originally made it thru 1.5 episodes when it first came out before losing interest. Came back to it finally a few weeks ago. As with most HBO shows it's visually impressive with a great cast.What disappointed me was the lack of action and pace to the show. It felt more like a As the World Turns wanna be GOT. There was not a great deal of action to be had to keep me interested for each episode.I'm hoping that things pick up for season 2. There's a lot of potential here for a great show.
"WHY THE FFF DID THEY CHANGE THE ACTORS... -__-"""
I was just starting to like Milly Alcock as Rhaenyra.She did a good job. The new actor has a whole different personality. You can't just replace actors like that and pick completely different people with different acting styles TwTSeriously dissapointed by this.She doesnt look the same. And the whole tension between the previous charachters is gone. As if I'm watching a new show..
"They could have made Milly Alcock and Emily Carey look older, just as they did with the actor playing Viserys.. And the rest of the cast didn't even age... like they seriously doing this. Who ever thought this would be a good idea."
"I rate the first and last three episodes an 8. The rest varying between 6 and 7.The overall season was let down by having only one storyline as opposed to GOT's multiple. There's also a lack of a range of characters. This is about a bunch of entitled rich people colluding for ultimate power. There's really no one worthy of our compassion and certainly no one that we can relate to. It was humorless as well.With GOT we had a huge diverse mix of characters from all walks of life. From royalty to peasants, soldiers, librarians, religious people, a vast mix. There's none of that here.The only way the two series are on equal footing is the look. And so it should look great for a ridiculous 20 million per episode.The interjections of sudden violence have become tropes. As is the shock value. (How many violent births did we see? It was its own clichÃ© by season's end).The time jump and change of characters was abrupt but it was possible to go along with the new characters, but it did lose a lot of momentum rather than escalating it.It's really got a long way to go to be even compared with its predecessor."
"Wow, as a huge fan of GoT, this is SO disappointing.Dull characters, boring plot (if there is one), and as others has said the fatal jumping ahead in years, with no warning, and a completely new cast....what were they thinking?? Terrible.Even the quality of the production seems poor, like some cheap BBC production (no offence BBC). Around Ep 6 found myself checking emails whilst wading through this drudgery.Really, for a production that should have had virtually unlimited budget considering the legacy it was dealing with, this is just boring garbage.Dont waste your time.Wont be watching any more seasons."
"Feels good to be back in Westeros again. Give it a shot. Won't disappoint for sure. The show can for sure turn out to be the worthy successor of Game of Thrones, if the upcoming episodes are as good as this one."
"So far, so good. High production values are reflected in the scope and scale of the show. Acting is across the board impressive, excellent cinematography and the very atmospheric soundtrack are brought together extremely well. I look forward to the next episode."
"You knew most reviews were going to be 10 or 1 just because of it being a GOT linked show, people will either automatically love it because their a fan or give it no real chance and complain about every little thing.I know it's easy to compare but I just tried to watch it as a new show whilst enjoying things that are familiar and also new.One argument I've seen is the ""woke"" casting, I understand that logic so many times in so many shows, however I only see it as an issue if the person playing the role is bad, if they do a good job then I don't think it matters at all. If it's bad performance and also cast for the wrong reason then it creates the new age arguments, for me I thought he was good and also the white hair with the skin tone for me looked class.The young girl is awesome! Although I couldn't tell if the friendship with the other girl is plutonic or a little more but I actually don't have an issue with stuff as long as it's done well, she for me is a star, saw her in that tim minchin show and she's just brilliant. The rest on the whole were decent at the worst, my one thing is, I don't love established actors in roles in these kinda shows, new actors or up and comers, I didn't even recognise Rhys for ages. I'm not a Matt smith fan, don't enjoy him at all, his voice irritates and his look for me just isn't something that appeals for me. However I actually thought he was alright. Just wish that kinda role could showcase a new actor.The story was slow but was always going to be, it had to introduce a lot, I actually felt it rushed through the heir bit to get that angle going but it all worked ok, seen complaints about the pregnancy scene, unsure why, with technology and lack of medical stuff they had then, I can't see that as anything other than realistic, i don't agree marking stuff down because you don't want to see something and not because it was done badly.The dragons didn't look far different from memory but I didn't notice anything aesthetically that stood out as bad, it didn't feel as polished as later in GOT but I'm unsure of budget. If I compared it to early GOT it looks better so it's 50/50.It did enough to intrigue me, It's very easy to forget a lot of shows don't get going for a couple of episodes when they have a lot to establish but I don't think this was a bad episode 1, my only kinda thing was not having a bit more side plots with other characters but there's not the most time in one episode.I'm interested to see where it goes, the king doesn't have the best presence on screen and I don't foresee him lasting that long with the heir being the big plot point. I did get similar vibes of Robert from him as in dying early. And princess gave me Arya vibes to.Overall not too bad, it had a tough act to follow but if you didn't see GOT and watched the first episodes of each I'd say this one was probably better looking but the content is vastly different and for me not comparable.Only thing I felt it lacked which I can't really moan about as it was a GOT thing, I miss the comic relief of Tyrian style character."
"The acting is great, the set designs are great but the script felt very draggy through a lot of the episodes. The main comparison I would have with HOTD and GOT is that GOT, especially in earlier seasons, did an excellent job at building with character development and dialogue tension. With HOTD it seems a lot of the script tries too hard to reach GOT level, and as a result the dialogue in some scenes just felt lacking with how slow it seemed.The character development was decent however, although I agree with many others in that the time jump seemed a bit messy. I was also a little disappointed we didn't get to see more classic medieval fight scenes especially with how much conflict there is in the series, but maybe we'll see more of this with season 2."
"As a political fantasy drama its not bad. A sort of Shakespeare-lite with dragons. The fact that makes it underwhelming is that we just dont care about these characters. They all get introduced one after the other in a big info dump. Immediately after all sort of terrible things happen, one after the other. Yes the death in child birth is tragic, but we barely know this woman. Yes , we can see this is a pretty terrible situation for the king, but we dont know him that well either, we dont even know we like him so do we feel sorry for him or what? The thing is, the first season of Game of Thrones got us heavily invested in the characters, thats why the beheading of Ned Stark just hurt so bad... We were all rooting for him: ""You fool, just get your men and go for it.... Dont trust that b.... Cersei!!!"" In House of the Dragon is just feels rushed and therefore it falls flat.The only remotely interesting character is that of Matt Smith, Daemon Targaryen. Its not completely clear what his character and personality are. Is he really a tyrant? Or is he a victim of a political game designed by the Hand of the King, who perhaps much rather has a weak king in place so he can rule in all but name? Its what makes the show watchable (just) but its hardly deep or original.The show feels very stale. The genious of Game of Thrones is that they tied the characters to specifuc locations which were all very different. The visuals aid the very complicated plot. The frosty north, the Meditarranean Kings Landing and the plains and deserts of the oversees lands. They could have done this with House of the Dragon too. The ""Oldtown"" faction could have actually played in Oldtown. Its a very iconic city from the books that they could have used to break it up and place different characters in different settings to distinguish themselves. For me all these beautiful and fantastical locations is what made the show. This was just people having conversations in a palace with just a dragon and a tournament thrown in there to break it up.The whole point of Game of Thrones (And A Song of Ice and Fire) is that we got to explore the world through the eyes of the main characters: We got to explore the North, The Nights Watch and The Wall through the eyes of Jon Snow. We got to experience the intrigue of the court through the eyes of Tyrion and in a very different way through Sansa Stark. We got to experience how it is to be down and out and having to fight for every crumb through Arya Stark, and of course the ways of the nomadic Dothraki and exotic slave trader cities through Daenerys. So it was never about these people, it was about the world in which they lived. That feeling was completely absent for me in the first episode of House of the Dragon. It was a very static and very conservative ""palace drama"" that could have been anywhere and anytime, it wasnt even fantasy apart from the dragon that was just trown in there and did absolutely nothing for the story.Acting is a bit hit and miss too. Matt Smith and Paddy Considine are great and already knew and love them from many other good shows, the rest however is completely forgettable. Especially the ""new Daenerys"" (already forgot her name tbh) was completely forgettable, but dont blame the actress per se as she had very little to work with. All in all, it was entertaining though. Good production value, good acting here and there and its just great to be able to visit The Seven kingdoms again... They just could have done a great deal more with all the material this IP can provide."
"I liked this show a lot, and it seems to have become a worthy prequel to GOT (not mentioning the last GOT season, of course). There's not a lot to criticize about the plot, yet. Minor details are left out. The only thing that actually bothered me, and I didn't see anyone else mention it, was that certain characters appeared to be vampiers or resemble eternal youth. While Daemon, Sir Cripson, and various other actors did not age a day, other actors aged 20+ years over the course of a single episode.It is a shame so little attention was paid to such details. I was actually wondering who was who and why this was happening."
"The good first. It's a very well shot and lit, high quality production with great costumes and special fx. Overall it's watchable even though it pales in comparison to the original's early seasons.With that out of the way, let's get to the bad. First off, the plot or lack thereof. There is nothing moving this thing forward. No overarching plot, no immediate danger, nothing to hook viewers really. It's meandering in search of a plot all season long, never to find one.Second the dialogues. You can't really expect the level of refined sophistication that comes out of books that were years in the making, but this just feels wrong. Everything is paper thin. It's more akin to a run of the mill teenage soap drama than Martin's work in ASOIAF.Third, the cast. Most choices are unconvincing to say the least. Nothing breaks immersion like feeling you're watching a dude with a wig spattering uncomfortable lines. And that's exactly the vibe this gives off quite often. Plus, switching your protagonist's actor mid first season is baffling and probably indicative of the overall casting mess.Fourth, the events. I've seen nothing that felt fresh. No new stories or ideas. Everything is rehashed content. Similar events and character archetypes that been done better in the past are retold with few if any interesting twists thrown in. Feels like copied homework.Fifth, the world. There are no multiple stories from different PoVs unfolding here. We're following one set of events in a more focused manner (very generous choice of words there). The inevitable outcome is a world that feels small. We're watching exclusively the same handful of people, all bunched up in one or two locations every time. You never get the feeling that there's stuff happening in the background. In this show, the world is where the camera is.Finally, consistency. One of the great successes of the original, was in presenting a world that made sense. Where every action had a reaction and far reaching implications. This diminished and eventually vanished in later seasons as they moved past the books and it is the case here as well. Events may or may not have consequences depending on the whim of the writers. Characters are not allowed to have a personality off screen. They'll say their lines at the convenience of each episode and turn off.Overall, compared to the original GoT this is more of a parody rather than a prequel. However, compared to what else is out there currently, it's alright I guess? Yay for low standards. 6/10."
"And not a very good one. Gave it 4 episodes, but the writing was so trite, the plot so predictable, and the characterizations were all over the place. Just soaked in boring mediocrity, despite half-hearted efforts to shock with sex and violence. Tries to put a shoddy girl power veneer on the same old tired middle aged man/teen girl medieval relationship. I genuinely wanted to like this, but I veered between zoning out in boredom and being mildly irritated by its insipid banality. I don't know how this is rated so highly; the quality just isn't there. None of the actors are particularly charismatic and none of the story lines are especially compelling. Very disappointing effort."
"We're back in Westeros and it already feels so magnanimous! Everything from the cinematography to the score is awesome, and DRAGONS! Lots of 'em!Great balance between pacing, nudity and violence, while also having great acting and VFX, end up making this easily comparable to peak Game of Thrones, by the end of the first season, it might even triumph season 1 of it's predecessor/sequel."
"SUCCESSION and the issue of male primogeniture - and this is beautifully set up with the opening scene showing the Great Council in 101 AC.A short intro but important to understand why Rhaneyra being chosen as heir spells a dark shadow that will carry through the episodes to come.As a book reader, I was greatly surprised in a positive way by how the showrunners enriched the book either by adding extra stories or elaborating on one aspects which were not in the book.Great acting from all casts especially Matt Smith and Milly Alcock. Smith's performance brings many nuances to the complex Daemon Targaryen.Art direction, costumes, cinematography are great. This era is supposed to be the height of the Targaryen's power and one of the opening shots shows King's Landing from aerial view (dragon rider's POV) which I think is very effective and grand.Two dragons are shown in the first episode and even though i read some people complained about why they are different from the dragons in GoT - I think they are great. Each dragon is so distinctively different and has characters of its own. Mind you they said there will be 15 dragons and being able to distinguish one from another will be an enjoyable watching experience.Lastly, the music scores from the great Ramin Djawadi totally brings you back to Westeros."
"From the very beginning it sets the premise with excellent scenes throughout the series with a engaging story arc befitting for a good series.The casting, cinematography, on-point acting, paving, visuals(esp. Dragons) and music/scores, revives that good'ol GoT feel with deeper, darker yet vibrant outlook brought to life by HBO.From the beginning you root for characters but this too is a rollercoaster; perhaps one of the many reasons why this series remains captivating; not leaving out the combat, warfare strategies, political intrigue, character fantasies, council meetings, love hate of kin, that yearning for one's own and the greater things for all of ages to come, all culminating into a thrilling series worth the watch, wait and investment..."
"""House of the Dragon"" stands as a captivating journey into the rich tapestry of Westeros, offering a visual feast and gripping storytelling. The performances, especially from Emma D'Arcy and Matt Smith, breathe life into the complex Targaryen characters. The show's stunning dragon sequences elevate the fantasy spectacle, and the world-building remains top-notch. While pacing may vary, the series successfully weaves intricate political plots. ""House of the Dragon"" is a worthy successor, maintaining the essence of ""Game of Thrones"" while carving its own path. A must-watch for fans and newcomers alike, it's a triumphant return to the enthralling world of Westeros."
"We said a devastating goodbye to Game Of Thrones, here's to a new era, the premiere was fantastic and definitely met expectations. Here's to many more years of House Of The Dragon!"
"In the beginning of the season, the show captivated me with nostalgia for Game of Thrones. However, as the show went on, many flaws became too apparent. By last few episodes, I was becoming annoyed, and here's why.1. There are too many scenes of talking, people lying on beds, taking long pauses, giving long meaningful stares to each other, etc. I understand it's meant to advance the plot, but there was way too much of just sitting in castles and talking, but not actually anything happening.2. I longed for an adventure, but never got it. GoT was best for its adventuring characters. Travelling through the wilderness, encountering all sorts of things. House of Dragon is literally about people sitting inside castles and talking 90% of the time.3. Change of actors in season 6 made no sense. Some actors remained, like Cole, who did not age one bit and stayed 20 years old. Others changed as people (which totally ruined my immersion and character development). While the King himself was one who was put make up on to look older. Question is, why didn't they do what they did with the King with the others? And if you will change actors, then why not be consistent and make everyone look equally older. Cole literally stayed the same age while everyone else aged, it was just so poorly done.4. Not enough action and excitement. A lot of boring scenes of talking that took up too much time. Of course you need dialogue scenes, but there were just too many in comparison to action/interesting scenes.5. Long and drawn out on purpose, to fill time and make it to one hour. It became apparent that they're basically purposely making the show longer to meet the one hour quota. This should have been done in half a season, but they milked it to the maximum.6. Predictable. I was able to predict things very well, which is not good. There should be surprise.Overall: not very exciting. Boring show. But I continue to watch because the good things about the show keep me interested: I love the fantasy world of RR martin, I love dragons, I love medieval times, I love how violent and brutal medieval times are depicted here, I love how there's constant evil vs good fighting, and constant human emotions being played with. So I will keep watching. But my god, it bored me at times to the point of annoyance."
"I'm pleased I held off on giving my 5-star rating initially; the series only improves with time. The acting is consistently strong, and Matt Smith truly shines. Initially, I struggled with the focus primarily on the Targaryens, especially after experiencing the diverse locations and houses in Ice and Fire. 'House of the Dragon' seemed to lack varied storylines initially, resulting in fewer character developments. Nonetheless, the familiar power play and plotting characteristic of this genre remain, making it just as addictive. For diehard fans, it is great to be back in familiar places. For new viewers, it may not be enough to compel them to come back next week."
"The series is really just very long winded so far. Nothing special happens and the whole first season feels like a prequel. I don't understand why it has such a high rating, because in direct comparison to Game of Thrones, there's a lot missing.Besides the few and lengthy storylines, the series lacks sympathetic characters above all. Seriously, who would come up with the idea of making a series with only unsympathetic characters? There is not one character with whom you can sympathize. I hope that changes with the next season.The series still lives very much from the Game of Thrones universe, which we were really looking forward to. That's what makes up the majority of the series, and that's why I watch it. I hope the series creators learn from the first season and see what is missing to turn a good mediocre series into a great one. Because it's still a long way from that, even if the hype around the series so far is window dressing. I think without Game of Thrones, this series would only bring fantasy nerds back in front of the screens every week."
"I lost my patience now after 5 episodes. I know this is not Game of Throne but does it have to be this bad? The pace is so slow that it feels that they just wanted to make sure there will be a second season. The first 5 episodes could have been packaged into 1 or 2 episodes.The casts of GoT have increased the bar so high that I feel sorry for the actors in this show. But in all fairness, the acting is really subpar for the hype. There is no chemistry whatsoever.I'm not sure where this is going. Maybe I'm not patient enough but the show has reached the mid season and I failed to see the direction of the storyline. For now, it feels like it's just a meaningless soap opera. I hope I'm wrong."
"Since the success of Game of Thrones, many fantasy shows have sprung up on the different streaming services. In my opinion most of these feel generic and rather unimaginative, they mostly even look the same. House of the Dragon does not. Yes, it looks similar to Game of Thrones but that only makes sense since it takes place in the same universe. It really feels like a GoT prequel and the quality seems to be on par with the original show thus far. The cast is very good, the sets look great and, unlike most modern fantasy shows, the story is interesting and immersive with well-written characters that don't fit stereotypical fantasy tropes. I'm really enjoying Matt Smith as Daemon Targaryen, but the entire cast does a pretty good job. This show is truly a breath of fresh air and I hope it maintains this quality throughout the rest of the show."
"I do not know how to begin this review. All of the fans from GOT came to watch this prequel. From the start i thought it was a very bad idea because honestly i don't have confidence in sequels and prequels. And when you try to top or at least gain the same succes like you had with GOT, it's very hard to obtain this.Every episode of GOT, even the boring ones had interesting characters and plot lines that were very much connected in some way. This STILL doesn't have it. Maybe it will change in time, but I seriously doubt it. I would rather watch the sequell spin-off of Jon Snow than this.And also what's with the CGI on the dragons? I mean we have massive dragons and these are such a joke."
Wasn't gonna watch it cause of season 8 but i did cause my girlfriend and sister wanted to so we bit the bullet. Its really good like game of thrones didn't end. Its very well written and acted they are setting a lot of stuff up for later but it doesn't stop anything from happening now during the story. If you start it it will b3 hard to stop. Nobody is a direct parallel of anyone from game of thrones but you can get certain vibes that will clue you into someones play in the story but somtimes they use that to mess with you. The action is just as striking and clever as the dialogue. Although be prepared for a few hard to watch moments in the first episode and young children should probably stay away.
"With wonderful acting and compelling characters but it was also complex. This show feels like its just trying to rush through some plot. GoT had multiple characters that you felt deeply for, both loving and hating. None of these characters have deep substance. Additionally we aren't following the grand and unique stories of several characters and anxiously awaiting to see how they collide. We are watching a single plot seem to race towards the end. This is visually beautiful but there is no emotional connection beyond hoping to see a glimpse of the connection to GoT.I'm very disappointed and I hope that next time a spinoff is made they take their time crafting the characters and the plot and less time pandering to the perceived desires of the audience."
"It is my pleasure to watch this movie, and my luck that in my time cinema has been reached to such a wonderful and awesome cinematography that is very excited to watch and give your goosebumps sitting in a cinema hole and watching it. This movie add it's flavour of action and thriller to such a level that can not be expressed in small words, this movie is based on a thriller action story, which is my favourite zone. So watching this movie is addup to me. More over coming to its cast, all actors played very real acting with full of emotion and same wise action too. I feel lucky to watch this movie. Thanking You."

"I agree with most of the seem-like real reviews: there's a problem with casting and wigs all along ! This alone takes a great deal of interest off the show, those peeps crowding the main stand are so bland and those white wigs don't give them justice ! Didn't they realize they looked cheesy, unappealing and unbelievable ?!? The whole thing made me just feel I was watching a bad thought out B movie.. But it's alright, budget reason so let's give it a try and go ahead.. In the end plot was just average, not hooked like GoT first episode but nevertheless watchable, but of course if that's gonna be it also on the next 2 episodes the hype will have all the reasons to wear off."
"Even GOT wasn't good in the first episodes, and the CGI was awful, House of thrones first episode was a little bit confusing, you have to get to know the characters like always. I am already starting to like some characters the King and most deffinetly his daughter.To say it's a 1 rating is totally abusurd, anything under a 5 I would say is suspect on here and you are not a GOT fan, maybe even some kind of alternate motive to put this down.Give it more of a chance.WHY IS IMDB ASKING FOR 600 CHARACTERS NOW TO SUBMIT?THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS, I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER FOR OVER 12 YEARS. All my reviews have been honest, professional, and respectful.**Update:"
"Rhaenyra Targaryen is really shining as an actress and character on here, I really like her, up to third episode of season 1. Third episode was better than second, can't wait for the fourth episode.UPDATE Episode 6.They messed it all up, they got rid of the original Rhaenyra and some others, But what is so ridiculous is that some of yhe old ones ate still there looking the same age.The story line does not connect with the last episode, I am about to give up on this series."
"In truth, the show presents all the GOT trappings, but offers none of its heart. Consider why we cared about GOT. First, we watched the Stark family children and their trials, torn from their home in the North: Sansa in King's Landing, then worse; Arya among the Nameless Men, then wandering Westeros with the Hound; Jon Snow at the Wall and beyond on his northern quest, then finding his truth with Dani. Secondly, the Lannister story-arc had legs. We came to care about both Jamie and Tyrion. Finally, we watched Dani rise from trophy wife to Targaryen queen. That is, we experienced these complex and beautifully written characters as they grew.Contrastingly, House of the Dragon offers no one to support, truly; no main character to root for. Thus, it descends quickly into mere palace intrigue, cut with gut-wrenching violence. Who do we like, here? The arrogant and self-serving Rhaenyra offers little empathy; and while the young Queen Alicent seemed sympathetic, she grows icy cold. The King's weakness undermines our connection to him and, finally, Daemon is just unfathomable. Put simply, we don't care about these people and, without character sympathy, the show is empty. Great stories aren't about what happens to people. They're about what happens to people we care about. A lesson HOTD should learn."
"Each episode is slower and slower. The story is written so poorly that the story writers need to explain the entire episode at the end of each one just so the audience can understand what they hell is going on. Each episode is time warping 10 years each time, I wonder how many generations of this royal family we will encounter by the end of the series. With each new episode I am less and less interested in what is next. Can't even come close to the original Game of Thrones and should not even been considered a prequel or related series. There is no need to add legs to the snake. House of the Dragon is HBO's desperate attempt to gain new subscribers and compete in the highly competitive streaming space. I hate it when a successful title like the original GOT is used as bait to get people to pay money for a prequel or sequel that was put together poorly purely for quick profits. Overall not impressed at all by House of the Dragon."
"Paddy Considine is more than you can hope for. What an actor! The art of playing a character like this is... just extraordinary. Episode 8 was just fantastic from his part. Hats of, kudos, I am so impressed.That said, I must also say that the show started of kind of slow and also felt kind of like a summary of the books. But it really took off during the last episodes, and I get why the first couple of episodes were kind of necessary. Each episode also has something beautiful or horrible. A truly great scene is when Rhanenyra rides her dragon trough the mist at Dragonstone. And in ep 8 the supper scene is perfect."
"I would say, im blown out by this. I thought naaah, nothing HBO will do that'll sink GOT, i have seen alot of spin-off that dmgoes down the drain, but this... I repeat, this.. is DRACARYS. I'm jealous of people who hadn't seen it already, I wish I was them so I'd have to experience it again for the first time. Looking forward to next episode next week."
"With the first season finished I think now is a good time to give my thoughts on the show. Many will say that this show is a lesser version of GoT but in truth this is a very different type of story to GoT. Many will complain about the pacing of the show. However, they seem to forget that the first couple of episodes are just setting up the characters and their motivations. In truth House of the Dragon is a brilliant show with incredible performances, cinematography, and writing. A stand out performance was undoubtedly Paddy Considine who gave King Viserys a rich and tragic story. With regards to cinematography the show uses a lot of shifting shallow focuses. This gives emphasis to how every character is equally important and have an important role to play. All of the dialogue in the show might not have been on par with GoT. Yet more often than not the writers matched the quality of dialogue that was in GoT. Every conversation between characters is layered with different motivations and the writing as well as acting shows it."
9.2/10
"If you told me after S8 of GoT that I would be fully invested in another story set in the same world I would not believe it for one second. But I sit here after S1 of HotD hooked and counting down the days until S2.I was skeptical to get invested in this when I heard that half way through the season that 2 of the main characters were getting new actresses. Not only that but all of the children in the show had 3-4 actresses. Boy was I wrong though, when episode 6 started it didn't feel like the show missed a beat. All 4 of the actresses that played Alicent and Rhaenrya did an exceptional job.It wasn't just those 4 either, every actor on this cast put forward an amazing performance. It says quite a lot when GRRM says in an interview that Paddy Consadine portrayed King Viserys better on this show then he himself wrote him in the book. In addition to the acting the writing for S1 was so gosh darn good. No line felt like it didn't belong or didn't have a purpose. There were so many scenes that had so much tension all due to the writing. This show brings me back to the early season of GoT where 2 people standing in a room having a conversation feels just as pivotal to character development and plot as a battle does.Lastly it would be criminal not to mention the cinematography of this show. Every scene is shot with purpose and meaning. If something is on screen the showrunners want you to see it. The set pieces of this show are spectacularly beautiful in every way. Not only that but the costume design is top notch as well. Every character feels like they have their own individual style and personality through their clothing.Its truly a beautiful thing to see so many different aspects of a show come together in such a cohesive way. And we're truly lucky that HBO didn't just scrap this universe altogether after the embarrassment that was GoT S8."
"I must confess, the first 5 series were okeish (we had enough of scenes to make jokes about, while still the show was not completely lost and kind of entertaining). But.....starting from the episode 6 we can't even make jokes anymore. The scenes are so slow and boring, the dialogues are not dialogues but just staring scenes. And there is even a bigger disappointment:"
"What happened to the wild and rebellious Rhaenyra? She was shown as a promising character, that she is there for something bigger, she talks to mother and says she does not want to give a birth.. she want to fly a dragon and may be to change the order of the realm (oh oh!) and become a first woman ruler. Intrigue! The next episode: years passed...she gives a birth..years pass again.. she gives a birth to what..6th child? And she does not make anything else. She is shown as a MOTHER without no other interested. This really makes me sad.. The only thing this character is missing to take all my hope from this life is to show how she and Daemon discuss mortgage and bills..(I am ok with having kids, but man.. does it have to end up with all your dreams and make you sooo boring and kill your character?)"
"another mind blowing ""twist""was with Alicent: ""ooh she wears green! Hightowers wear green when they announce war."" Intrigue! Next episode: X amount of years passed... she also has a lot of children. Wow! That was a shocking revenge indeed.I better watch my cat."
"EDIT!Okay, so when I am wrong, I can admit it. House of the Dragon is NO GoT Seasons 1-4.The third episode was still beautiful, but it just lacked heart, soul, fire ... I don't know precisely, but SOMETHING. We watched 40 minutes of whiney Targaryens, and were rewarded with a good (not great) scene, that missed showing the most important fight sequence / kill.I would like to think it is going to get better, but I believe they really tried with the last two episodes (2 & 3), yet could not quite sell it. As much as I hate to say it, this might just be a miss. :(________________________________"
"Original review:OMG. It's like looking at GoT, but with better production value - it is beautiful in the way this (these) series SHOULD be, and as realistic and 'gritty' and bloody as it should be without going overboard. The mix of every element which made the first seasons of GoT great, are present, and they are all presented fluidly without any one theme overpowering the other. From the opening musical sequence to the ""LoTR's-like"" narrative (which BTW, is a spot-on kicker if you're a woman) and JUST the facial expressions ... you can't help but become immersed.Small disappointments, were the dragons themselves, or at least for me, the very first glimpse we get of one. Intermittently, it looked better (in some scenes great; others, not). I was expecting MORE, or at least more consistency on this all-so-important aspect of the series. I mean, It IS House of the DRAGON(s). The dragons must be irreproachably, impeccably, PERFECT.Also, although it may be an unpopular opinion, and not very ""PC"" of me to say ... the actress who plays the young princess Rhaenyra, IN MY OPINION, just does not meet the level of physical 'perfection' a Targaryen merits in my mind. In Got-Speak, I see ""commoner"", or at best, tavern wench. While unique looking, which is surely what they were searching for, I think - almost as with the dragons - that I was expecting MORE. This is meant with no offense to the actress who plays her, as I am certain she is great for/in other roles. Goddess Emilia Clarke, however, she is NOT. Then again, perhaps she is not meant to be.Lastly, not to sound snarky or worse, as I am sure I will be accused of being, but the platinum-hair thing I thought (erroneously, apparently), was caused due to a bit of Albinism or lack of pigment. I guess I was wrong?In closing (because we are about to watch it again - EDIT: we've watched it 3x's), all I can do is PLEAD with the show-runners that this not be a let-down and that they see it through, unrushed, and with the intent of being a series that will surpass others in creativity and scope, rather than being led solely by the mighty dollar. ...So far, they seem to be on the right track."
"We are into 3 episodes so far and its a safe bet to say they have nailed so far with this series. In the previous interview they used ""dragons"" as a marketing scheme to allure viewers to the series and I thought they were just going to ruin it but so far it has not only been about them but also about the betrayal,love,envy and ofcourse fire and blood.The acting of every one gets better and better as we progress through the episodes. We get to see Matt Smith(Daemon) excercise his ability to his fullest after watching the disappointing Morbius. Paddy Considine(Viserys 1) is no joke either,we heard a lot about the Mad King so watching the character of Viserys is somewhat a refreshment. As the episodes furthers we get to see the different layers of Viserys who is stuck with a dilemma but still trying to do the right thing. Overall it's been a blast so far, hope the rest of the episodes hold the quality we've seen so far."
I wasn't planning on watching but decided to give it a shot. First episode wasn't near on par with episode 1 of GoT. The characters were fairly boring. It may get better and I hope it does.
"Casting was a disaster it seems, not confident to go with new actors, not bold enough to put money down for great known actors. It's a mixed bag, along with the delivery of lines and the scenes in general come across very flat and uninteresting.Of course a big part of that is the script which is frankly disappointing, given all the time and learning from the complete unmitigated disaster of the last 2 seasons of 'Game of Thrones', it seems the HBO are part of the problem here and it wasn't just David Benioff and D. B. Weiss who were the issue with the script writing department and plot planning in the previous show.In this case the desperation was obvious by the title cards, and the marketing stuff, that keep reminding the viewer that this show is ~150 years prior to Daenerys Targaryen. Not prior to the events of GoT., but prior to Dany. Specifically Dany. The character that they screwed up the most in the entire show. So let's go through this for a second, in GoT the Dany plotline was poorly handled, leading to a terrible ending and a waste of a character that annoyed most of the fans (especially the Dany fans).Why is house of the dragon linked to GoT, and why Dany in particular? I thought it was obvious that people don't want to be reminded of that disaster any more, along with the disappointment of the waste of the other characters such as John (aka an actual true Targarian and heir and king).But it gets worse. For some reason the show blows its load in the first minute by having a dragon fly around the place with a rider on it. Zoom in and play some of Dany's music from the previous show. Like seriously? Playing Dany's theme tune from another show... in this show, which has nothing to do with her or GoT. Frankly it was not only stupid but insulting to the audience.I realise now they (HBO) still think they did a good job on the final season of GoT, and that they think the Daenerys character was well written. Mind you, it wasn't even the 'evil' Dany music they reused here, it was the benevolent one. The one they always did to uplift you and tell you how good and great she was. Hah. I get that this story is about a bunch of Targs who are going to fight and kill each other to be King/Queen, so did HBO get that? I don't think they understand what they are even doing here.So back to the first episode, it is incredibly dull. Lots of boardroom talk, boilerplate speeches and dialogue. No character development, no characters that are relatable or likable. A palette of dull multi-colored faces that have no connection or coherence for the time period or the material at hand. Great for the actors, but with terrible application.A waste of money to make, they should have remade the final season of GoT into 3+ more seasons and not chosen a poor spin off.4/10 a boring soap opera for people who really don't like fantasy, and a far cry from season 1 to 4 of 'Game of Thrones'; but not as offensive as the later ones."
"This could take a turn for the worst but for 3 episodes in im really enjoying the show. I got hooked the first episode, I think the characters are interesting and they are all potayed very well. It is a tad bit slow at times and its alot of Dialog, but thats made up for with the importance of it, everything said and done is important to the story and the development of the characters, nothing so far has been filler or useless, its all been important to the show in one way or another. The scenery is shot really well, everything looks real and believable, even the cgi with the dragons, i think the dragons look really good in this."
"I think all the 10 star reviews came right after the first couple episodes, when we were excited by the potential for this show. However, each successive episode got worse and by episode 7 (the most recent episode at the time of this review) it is barely watchable. The time jumps are unfortunate because all the drama that built up in the previous episodes is rendered irrelevant. The characters start acting ""out of character"" because they go through changes in between episodes that are implied but unexplained. And in spite of a blistering pace of time jumping, the pace of the episodes is painfully slow. On the bright side, the cinematography is just as beautiful as the original series. I am hoping for this show to turn around and get exciting again but starting to have serious doubts."
Quite a few of the reviews on here have said that the characters are boring and that they have no emotional connection to them. I'm response to this I say1) Did you have a deep emotional connection with Jaime Lannister after 5 episodes ? How about Theon? How about Arya ? I doubt it. It takes time to bond with the characters and often it is the growth of the character that makes us love (or hate) them. Not necessarily how they are at the start of the story2) Episode 8 is as emotional as almost any GOT episode certainly more so than any of S1. The acting in this episode is awesome. Kudos to paddy3) You have seen Daemon Targaryen?
Update:
"Ok. I have watched the season and liked it. Definitely great but not at the level of the original. Like LOTR, the shows typically have a million characters with all unusual names and takes a bit to track. But in this show, it's a manageable amount of characters, but constant changing of actors made it confusing to track through what seemed arbitrary jumps. Luckily, the plot was pretty basic (still entertaining), otherwise I'd have been lost.Original post:Not going to lie...I felt overwhelmed in the beginning at so many names and trying to place what's going on.But the show roots itself well and it's basic tenets have been told thousands of times before.Hiw the show goes about the first half....is your show and tell you a ton of confusing and gruesome scenes, then let's you take the second half to figure out whyShow is delivering well. But I hope the confuse and explain later technique lessens. Because not all of us read the books and memorized locations, families, etc.I just want a rich vibrant show. So far so good."
"I want to love this. I realllllly want to love this series. I convinced myself I was loving it ep1-3. But as you sit back and actually review what that have produced thus far, 5 eps in... It is nothing more than a melodrama set in the world of GOT. There are maybe... 5 characters and the rest are extras.Plots are being set up, not by clever writing but by stupid, obvious, out of character mistakes by the characters that had half an episode build up.Sir C telling the Queen. Dumb.Daemons wife in the Vale seemed like an excellent interesting character.... Killed off screen after 5min.Daemon getting with Rhaenra. Out of no where.Really disappointed... Everything we hated about season 8... Is happening here."
I am a fan of GOT and the expectations are high.What I like :
the dragons look nice and realistic. The CGI are good.i like the idea of the prequel because I miss GOT.What I don't like :
after 8 episodes I still do not know what are my favourite characters because there is no development yet. Everything is dark and politic talking.it's only about the targaryen. Where are the other kingdoms? I know it's the house of dragon but I expected to see more families and enemies like GOT.the story takes place in the castle and that's all. No main plot and no adventure or side stories.where are the battles and the action? Please take a little break of politic talking and give us fights.I just hope it is just a slow burn and the action will arrive soon.My rate is 7/10 because it is good but can be a lot better.GP.
"Don't invest yourself into another heart break. They managed to completely capture the audiences attention and then stab the audience in the back by changing main actors mid-season. This was to show age progression but the kicker is nobody else aged one bit. Everyone else looks the same but the two main female actors were completely changed. It's like watching an entirely new show. And they introduce the changing of the main character so abruptly and so forced with the opening scene that you just are completely lost and confuse and then completely shocked when you release that this is supposed to be the same person. What a waste. What a shame. And what a shame it is on me for give them another chance.Update: Okay, I just watched the season family. Changing my rating from a 6 star to an 8 star. If you can hang on an accept the main actors changing mid season than it is definitely worth watching. They will do 3 age jumps but the age jumps from 1 to 2 are the worst of it. After that, reinvest yourself and you will come to like it. Change of heart for me about this show forsure. I apologize , I'm just still very much hurt from what they did to the Game of Thrones ending that it's hard to trust them again fully."
"Game of Thrones seasons 1-7 were one of the best in television history. A successful, captivating, well-written story with mostly accurate casting (except the fact Targaryens in the book have purple eyes and are very tall, thin and striking, Tyrion has a very deformed face etc.) and very memorable faces for our characters. House of Dragon personally just lacks the memorability, it was a pretty bad casting, the characters do not have the look or the vibe of the characters in the book.The first two episodes were mildly boring, completely deprived of the shock we experienced watching the first episode of GoT. Still, the camera is amazing, beautiful scenery and there you can see the budget. Still, the huge budget does not help the way the story is being told."
"So 300 years or something before the events of game of thrones & i have to say those buildings were built to last. The story is a fast paced one, miley alcock & olivia cook have delivered. Matt smith as daemon targaryen was good & paddy considine as viserys played king who is fundamentally weak but difficult to get rid off. The show uses characters swapping to show the years past except aging the characters except for two characters which I'll not tell but all in all it is a very well made show but it will take you a few episodes to get hooked but i believe its worth it it's a kind of show got fans would appreciate & somewhat feel better after the debacle of last season but hey! It's a pretty beautifuly well written show however there were some elements which i feel a little edgy & should not be included olso it is quite a diverse cast &"
So to conclude it will take some time to get used to bit you'll love it.
"Same world, different heart. For the first time, there is narration and lots of exposition in a Thrones episode and it feels wrong. Don't tell me what I'm supposed to care about, show me something with heart. The premiere of og GoT was full of scenes and lines whose sole purpose was to show us that the characters were like real people you would actually meet in medieval times. HotD's focus (based on comparing its premiere with that of the original) seems to be on spectacle: the dragons, tourneys, royal succession drama, and gender role dynamics. Very little time is allowed for really getting to know these people. They don't feel real, messy, or broken, like in the original.I'm hopeful that this will change now that the stage and stakes have been set. I would like to really see what kind of people Rhaenyra and Daemon are. But if the show continues to bend the knee to cheap thrills then I'd have to say: maybe the apple hasn't fallen far, but its core has been ripped out."
"This is the most boring and confusing bs I have ever watched. I watched GOT 3 times over. And still! Just what I wanted... a show where I have to get online and figure the **** out who everybody is while I watch it. Never knew just what I needed was too rewind 42 times because I missed something, on account uh, I'm also doing research.... There is no comedy, my dad hates that the most, Tyrion, the Hound right off the top of my head, hilarious! I get we're going back even further, and the ages are getting darker. But I haven't laughed one time watching this, it's hard on account uh, how dull it is. If this gets any worse or stays as bad as it is just call it. Wait till dude writes a couple more books then bring back GOT."
"Imagine Game of Thrones without Tyrion, Jamie, Cersei, Joffrey, Daenerys, Arya, Sandor and many more. Kind of dull right? Well this is The House of the Dragon.Apart from Daemon which is mildly interesting, there is not one character that I care for. They are all insipid, too serious, depressing. I was hoping that in the second episode we would be shown some of the other houses and their members, but no. We are stuck with this soap opera family we don't care about.This show does not deserve the same intro theme as Game of Thrones. It's just bad spinoff.I would have go over the fact that the characters are dull if at least the story was good. But it's about a guy thinking if he should marry or not."
"WOW! What an amazing start to this Game of Thrones prequel series. I am so invested in all the characters and storylines and am really excited on where it goes. The music, VFX and acting were all 10/10. Such an amazing episode. :)"
"It is not at all easy carrying blockbuster GOT vibes but, HOD is beyond everything. Unbelievable caste, lots of art in every frame, dragons and mostly everyone is performing superb. Waiting for Demon and Aemond in Dance of Dragons. Actually until now it is mostly focused on telling story other than only action if everyone is starting connecting to characters then come is ultimate war sequences and most famous deaths of our loved ones and also if anyone looking for GOT there comes prequel SNOW with Jon has twin sister there comes the actual hunt and drogon has some more eggs... it's all GOT HOD SNOW and Old Veleria."
"I think overall this show is great. Good acting, good characters. I'm glad that they now settled in a timeline so we can get more character development in season 2. I like the build up, while it is slow and may bore some, I think it's cool to see how actions taken over several years slowly and steady leads up to what seems from the finale, a great war in season 2. My only complaint is that the cgi looks very off from time to time, especially the close ups of when they're riding the dragons. The green/blue screen is too obvious and it takes away from the feeling, power and intensity of some scenes. I hope they fix this for season 2."
I went in blind with kind of low expectations from how game of thrones ended and I ended up loving this. Season 1 of house of the dragon is the fantasy drama show of the year. It is worth the watch. The characters are fantastic as you see them grow in depth. The acting is very very good. No one feels out of place and the casting choices were perfect. It is a little confusing with the time jumps and swapping actors but the story is there. This show will be huge nearing the final seasons and I think a lot of fans will comes back. If you are on the fence Id recommend this show. Enjoy this first season!
Well deserving of the high ratings/ praise it's definitely as good as the original! The perfect crew to helm George R. Martins baby and so far they've done exceptional especially by creating massive sets and atmosphere. I'm glad episode 2 is calmer than the pilot there was an overload that occurred I guess that was a wild way to start but could've gone without already having a couple battles otherwise magnificent the way it is! There's times I don't understand some of the story cause of complex dialogue yet it's always entertaining. I'm sure House of the Dragon will be just as glorious as Game of Thrones was and adored no matter what happens in it.
"This show consistently falls flat episode after episode. They are obsessed over one aspect of the plot and none of the others that support the storyline. It's just... flat. They are taking parellels from GoT, naturally, but not using that nostalgia people love effectively. It's just flat.There's a lot of gaps in making connections for the audience. Aegon married his sister? Wasn't clear. Doesn't clearly show how ridiculous Alicent behaved finding out Rhenerya ""slept"" with her uncle.The Seasnake just up and leaves his family for years without us seeing that or any build up? Y'all ran out of time that fast? The pacing is a mess.Another example of holes, in the funeral scene for the child, everyone is present and bows except her two children with Daemon. Where are they? Why aren't they there? Did the creators run out of budget for child extras? There's several moments of this in every episode.Matt Smith and Emma have no chemistry. Don't even seem to like each other. I think this is the fault of the writers and directors. She miscarried and he didn't act remotely remorseful? Didn't go to her to comfort her? A joke. Terrible writing.The dialogue itself is plain. I've read better fanfics. At least this isn't a 10 just to disappoint later. Please improve this show."
"The show is so far good. If the show is this good and yet they have only shown one family after the throne, it will will be more when we get to see the Starks, lannester etc. The dialog is good, the casting is excellent. These are the bases of a successful show.Also keeping the cinematic and melodic effects found in the first GOT keeps the show consistent with the first series. What I just hope for is the series to only cast directors who have passion, genuine passion for the show. Something the last GoT lacked in its closing seasons when it was rushed to conclusion yet it had many seasons to offer.I hope you find the series engaging as I have found it. Enjoy!!"
"I so wanted to enjoy this. The main challenge initially was one that any sequel to a big hit has to overcome. A new story, without our preloved characters, that doesn't have the advantage of presenting the wonder of a new story world. But I managed to get through this, and over the first few episodes, developed a healthy viewers attachment to the new characters and was enjoying the show.Then episode 6 lands. A ten year gap, with new actresses playing THE most important roles, and new characters. I spent the first half of this episode trying to work out who was who, what actors remained, what characters remained, who the new actors/actresses were portraying and what the hell was going on. But I plodded through.Then episode 7. They do the same thing. New actors and actresses in many roles, new important characters & another jump through time. Again, who's who and what's going on?Episode 8 and they unbelievably did it again. I was at least comforted by the fact that the post episode 5, Alicent actress (Olivia Cook), addressed a guard using the wrong name. At least I wasn't the only one who was completely lost.Ironically a few scenes later, the post episode 5, Rhaenyra actress says,.... assumably referring to the king, but who knows?..... ""He looks like a different person"". Now they're just having a laugh, given he was still the same actor.There is great potential for the second series, but please stop the clunky and jarring jumps in time, characters and actors playing the roles, that require the viewer to play catch-up so often."
"This series is a joke compared to season 1 to 6 of GOT, it fails completely in charachater developement, writing, Acting, Directing. I doubt there was even a single witty funny dialogue in 6 episodes, things just randomly happen, all the actors except for daemon's and visery's can't act and there is an utter lack of birthing scenes in the series, they should do 2 for each episode. Seems like they are pandering the series to teenage girls whereas GOT for young guys and now have created a badly written soap like Riverdale. I was hopefull after episode 1 and after that I wasn't able to complete the episode in 1 seating because its so boring.. please make a different prequel/sequel already."
"Fantastic opening episode. Peak thrones. Dialogue was pretty good too. Really high hopes for the season now, they set up the building tension between each faction brilliantly and the introduction to each character was done perfectly. Can't wait for the next one.It felt like classic GoT. Conflicting character growth, a steady plot line, meaningful violence used as a plot device, different factions vying for power. I'm hooked!The set and costume design made GoT look like community theater. I was blown away by the heraldry and attention to detail. Bloody well done!"
"I was actually a little bit skeptical about it at first because of the immense success of Game of Thrones and since this is a prequel i thought ""well, isn't that hard to top?"" it is hard to top. Yet, they are still getting very close to it, it's definitely on the way and faster than i thought, the first season started off so strong and we are heading to the finale and it's still so good. I'm actually having a hard time waiting for the episodes every week because it's too good, keep me thinking about it! It's amazing, it doesn't get behind the sequel, at the very least. The cast is effing talented and fitting, such good acting and chemistry. Brilliant. Astounding directing, scenarios, dressing...it's so so good. (also emma d'arcy? They are insanely good)."
"I've seen so many reviews claiming this show has gone ""woke"" because apparently there is black Targaryen. You are all wrong and apparently can't even pay attention to names or what's going on. The black man seating with the king's council is Corlys Velaryon. You all can't even see a black person in a show because immediately dismiss it with the ""woke"" card. First episode was solid and shows a lot of promise. It's good to be back to Westeros."
"This one does it all great: Casting, dialogue, settings, dressing, pacing... The characters are believable and intriguing. Backgrounds don't seem plastic or out of place. CGI is used mostly superbly, adding dragons, ships and whatnot to the screen, having fewer full CGI shots.You immediately care for (or take interest in) the characters and you can't wait to see what happens in the story.Not one roll-eye moment so far. Never picked up the phone in a moment of boredom. Greatest disappointment is the starting bit: it makes no sense, seems to be there only so they could play the same music again.So this is a total opposite of RoP so far."
"I had that GoT feeling again. The acting could be better but let's face it, the GoT S1 was not that good in acting and polishing. HotD E1 was far better than the last GoT last 3 seasons."
"Its true that HOD started a bit slow, but is normal considering that the main actors first appear in the 6th episode, when the real story begins, the crazy fight for the throne among the family. I dont understand why people is already rating this series so bad when the real action is just coming up. The darkness of the seventh episode is epic, and it gives us a glimpse of what we'll see later, introducing us to Aegon, Aemond, Jace, Luke and company wich will be very important agents to the seek of the iron throne.Remember guys, this is not GOT, this is focused on Targaryen history and the darkness inside of it."
"I have been trying to find positive points about this series but failed miserably so far.The Dialogues are not sharp. The Plot is weak. No interesting characters so far including the main ones.When the main characters are also boring, you can imagine how is it going so far.It's running just because of the GoT hype.Just a boring version with good production value in the name of GoT prequel.I so miss GoT characters, their wit, wisdom, backstabbing, deaths and so many other things.I have been trying to find positive points about this series but failed miserably so far.The Dialogues are not sharp.

"Wow what an epic and awesome and beautiful series it's really amazing, everything in the show was iconic I love it and the fact that this is the only series that i felt like game of thrones I mean I know this series is like a sequel or explanation of events that were before got but it's really similar.I really liked the story of the series, the events and the action footage and of course the design of the dragons, i mean the whole series was extravagant and incredible, this things makes you wish to watch more of this masterpiece series and enjoyed it.In the end I really want to say that i am waiting so much to see season two of house of the dragon this masterpiece series is so great."
"I had high hopes for this show when I saw the previews for it but after starting to get to know the characters a bit, there is a big time jump. So much for connecting with the character and the actor playing the part. I had to stop the show and look to see I was watching the next show from the week before. In GOT we watched character grow up, evolve and you could really connect with them and if something tragic happened you were shocked and at times saddened. With this show they could wipe everyone and I wouldn't bat an eye, well except the kind King maybe. Hoping they get some better writers soon. No offense intended writers, but even you have to shake your head at this train wreck."
"House of the Dragon is capable matching the technical quality of Game of Thrones. But sadly, it is not capable of providing the excitement which was there while watching GOT.The first episode looked promising. But the show didn't get any better. The casting went so wrong. Neither the characters, nor the actors are likeable. They don't have the charm like the cast of GOT. Remember how we felt when Bran was pushed out the window and the credits started rolling in the very first episode of GOT? That feeling is missing from this. And the sudden jumps in time disrupts the flow of the story.There's no one to root for. I hope it gets better.Edit(E5): Finally! It gave me the GOT vibe. It's funny how Westeros has the most intense weddings. Alicent's entry was so good.Edit(E6) : Ruined it again. The jumps in time are too much. The casting problem still remains. No one is likeable. They come too quickly, they dies too quickly. It's not an engaging story either. The conversations aren't intriguing either."
"I always said while watching Game of Throne "" I hope they make a show about the Targeryn history"" and they have and its AMAZING!What a prequel to one of the best shows of all time this one is right up there with GOT easy.Amazing performances by the whole cast! The dragons are awesome as well.Matt Smith again doesn't disappoint love this guy.I was hopinng this would start with aegon the conqueror as well that would have been amazing to see.So to sum it up if your a GOT fan and you haven't seen this, watch it now!What an amazing 1st season and here is all hoping season 2 doesn't take 2 years pls!"
"Good start . Season 1 is a good basement for the upcoming seasons of house of the Dragon . First up all don't compare it Game of Thrones plot , GOT is a conflict between the houses , HOTD is civil war within the house . Yes HOTD isn't great as GOT , but without comparing it's still a good series . Series had different kinda story telling , story was bit rushed and too many time jumps , felt bit weird and bit difficult to settle . It had many intresting high points and goosebumps moments too . Characterisation was well designed for each character , even characters who appear jus for 5-10 mins created impact . Once again casting was great and cast performance were good . Technically stronger ; cinematography , VFX and colour grading were awesome . Production design did a great job . Once again mind blowing background score from Ramin Djawadi . Overall a good first season and strong basement to the upcoming seasons ."
"Good scripting, good casting everything perfect. The cinematography is nice the dragons design is good. It has a good plot like the original and also the flash backs about aegon targeryon, the song of ice and fire. Hope it exceeds GOT."
"Top tier acting and HBO quality baby, simple as. The hype was real and GoT has returned with another powerhouse of a series, hopefully for years to come."
"HBO nailed it again.It takes you back to Westeros but with an upgrade which works well ,vibe is there.The cast looks good ,didn't saw much part from other lords and actors in the first episode,but the major actors are fitted perfectly like a gem.The Intensity and the tension between the characters can be felt ,which is very good.Costume design,set design everything looks good ,"
Can't wait for the rest of the episodes.Team Daemon Targaryen 🙌
"I didn't know what I was expecting, I admit I wasn't a fan of some changes but the episode felt more ASOIAF than GoT ever did. This is just my personal opinion but THIS is more like George's story than the main series. Fire & Blood was written like a history book so we didn't know the characters as we do with the main books but wow, the characters felt real and tangible. LOVE the acting, LOVE the expanding of characters without it feeling out of place. Bring on the next episode!"
"Tho I was always waiting for more to happen, it simply doesn't - it's just too boring. A lot of talking, but even so interesting. Just a sad story. Changing the actors is also pretty annoying, the new ones are way worse, dull.Of course I'm comparing with GOT, which was way more interesting and well made than this. Such a pity when you're expecting so much and getting so little. All the wait for what.I do like the dragons tho, but even that seems a bit take, as the special effects are a little off. And they are not even used that much.I'm sure they are holding all the action for the last episode, but I can't just watch 10 episodes for the last one."
"What's up with all the hair? Why does it looks so fake and lame on almost every actor except chosen few? Looks cheap as hell and same applies to CGI and armor.In general I am not impressed by this show, most stuff was just mediocre or even worse."
"9.2/10.This show started off really strong and ended strong. They managed to restore my faith in the Game of Thrones universe after the travesty that was season 8. This season introduced us to many well written complex characters and an intriguing story that thrusts us right into the midst of this power struggle for the iron throne. King Viserys is without any doubt the best character from this season. His character arc was excellent. From flamboyant king who's only desire is to host tournaments and enjoy the splendors of the world, to broken and weak but yet stronger then ever. Viserys's throne room walk is definitely the best scene in this entire show.Overall this was a Fantastic season of television and is definitely in the top 5 greatest shows of 2022. My favorite episodes of this season are 1x7 ""Driftmark"", 1x8 ""The Lord of the Tides"" and 1x10 ""The Black Queen""."
"I bought the Fire and Blood book, starting reading it, and it's more exciting than the series thus far. For instance, I fell asleep last night midway through the episode. It just drags and who am I supposed to root for? The plot seems to be lost or something...maybe it'll pick up soon later in the season. Really hoping it turns out better, but I've decided to not watch anymore until season 1 has ended. It will be less frustrating if I read Fire and Blood, and then binge watch the remaining episodes, instead of following every week, which has become extremely painful.If I had to pick a favorite character at this point, it would be between Viserys and Alicent, and that's sad because they are not exciting characters at all. Daemon seems to be the most charismatic of all, but is also unlikeable in my opinion, at the same time. It's like watching Game of Thrones, but instead of having the Starks and Lannisters, it's like the Lannisters and the Lannisters, very boring so far."
I have watched five episodes and I am becoming very disappointed. I had high expectations because it was a prequel for GOT. I realize not every episode of a show is going to be awesome but come on now this show is getting worse. The characters stories are moving at an jumpy irregular pace which is confusing. The dialogue is not written or delivered well and it makes the characters have no charisma. The storyline is weak it makes the final season of GOT look like an eight out of 10. What it boils down to is that I am becoming very bored with the show. I will try to stick with it for a couple more episodes. I hope.
"The reign of House Targaryen begins.This is Rhaenyra Targaryen's story.Before Daenerys Targaryen was the famous ""mother of dragons"" in ""Game of Thrones,"" her ancestor, Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, was set to become the first ruling Queen of Westeros.Millie Alcock as young Rhaenyra Targaryen, I find her quite exotically captivating .Keeping up with the tradition of Thrones its bloody and there are a few Easter Eggs referencing the original series.The cast are all superb so far, costumes and sets are decadent and look fantastic.Truly amazing Cinematography, the tranquil yet spine chilling music, and the building of tension the story line are all superb. George R. R. Martin is one of the best fantasy writers out there.House Of The Dragon season 1 episode 1 (The Heirs of the Dragon) with no doubt it has the same striking skill of creativity so abundant in the original Game Of Thrones !The game is on ! It feels safe to say viewers can get excited."
"If Game of thrones had any greatest flaw, it was pacing. The botched 8th season was caused mostly by trying to wrap up all the story lines with too little time to do them properly. House of the Dragon seems to have learned nothing from this. If anything, they spend the majority of the first season talking politics, like they had to do a long drawn out nit of world building before they could get to all the fun. World building being defined as 80% stationary people talking about politics, 10% gratuitous people with no clothes on, and 10% actually interesting things happening. The apparently did go to the HBO seminar on Sexposition- where when one has a tedious bit of plot line to get through, have naked people doing it, so the folks with short attention spans can have some boobies and buttocks to look at.The whole of the first season was wasted as preamble to what will supposedly happen in season 2. It could have been run though easily in 3 episodes, if you cut out all the pregnant pauses and lengthy shots of atmosphere. At this rate, they may.spend the next 3 seasons talking about what to do, and the actual war of succession will be the last episode of the last season."
"Nevermind the trolls who are review-bombing, House of the Dragon is a very good show that is hopefully here to stay. It is well-shot and well-acted, and it is very faithful to the books with the exception of a few deviations that are really a non-issue. If you're into the ASOIAF universe, this is a must-watch."
Lots of gore does not make a story. Bloody scenes involving characters who only appeared for 5 minutes meant you didn't know them enough to care. Lots of dialogue that didn't contribute to the story or move it forward. I can overlook the bad CGI if the story is interesting- but there was no story to get interested in. I am a great fan of several of the actors- but they had nothing to work with.I see people talking about how well the tournament and jousting was filmed? Perhaps- but that's boring to me.Game of thrones drew me in from the start-the mystery of the blue eyed walkers-the meaningful looks between characters-the anticipation of what would happen next.This was a boring exhibition of special effects- some of them not so special.- - - - - - - -Edit: I've stuck with this series -because I wanted to like it. From episode 4 it has begun to draw me in. There is a story developing now.I will stick with it for the first series at least. It's beginning to generate interest-and looking forward to the next episode.
It lives up to the hype. GoT Season 1-4 story-wise with Season 5-8 budget. I like that the time jumps aren't confusing and the season is linear. Clear and concise character motivations. Overall a 10/10. Don't know what else to say.
"The show follows the book and that is a great thing for me. Some reviewers are complaining that it is not as GOT, but if I could count how many GOT's episodes were useless and without any importance...It's kinda obvious they could not go directly into the bloody action, which is taking place over decades, so...you need to build the story first and this will be a pretty good one. Until now (currently episode 8), I wouldn't have imagined a better ""prelude"" to what is about to happen. Everything was on point, in the short ammount of time they have, to compress all of the important details.Apart of that...I am really loving Olivia Cooke as Alicent.P. S. Patience...patience...patience."
"I liked the first episode, everything is reminiscent of Game of Thrones, although not everything is as great as Game of Thrones, especially the special effects, and also the actors are not as good as Game of Thrones, but the book Fire and blood is also weaker compared to fire and ice song, I hope the next episodes will be good."
"The first half of the first episode was so bland and boring that I literally found myself falling asleep.The second half got a little better. It just good enough that I will probably watch the second episode as well, but if there is no improvement I'll probably be quitting this show only two episodes in.All but maybe two of the characters are interesting to me. This show has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to live up to it's predecessor."
"The first episode takes us only in Kings Landing court where tragedy strikes: the king elected years ago is now in the situation to choose: his wife or his unborn son. But he s option fails as the son lives just for a day. He names his daughter as next queen despite his previous intent to name his young brother. The young prince is a warior, unsatidfied with his life, with being send to remote land. The conflict is about to start as the court swears oath to the soon the be queen"
"The production. The dialog, the actors are just as good as those from Game of Thrones.The only surprise for me is the oral message every Targeryan king or queen transmits only to his chosen prince or princess: Aegon had the premonition about the long night and this was one of the reasons he took Westeros."
"The show has great writing, directing, and cinematography, but the casting choices are terrible. Not a single interesting character. Someone decided to hire British B-list actors instead of striking characters like in GOT. I'm not even trying to compare the two shows, but how can you not acknowledge the lack of interesting characters in this one. We are a visual culture, and we want interesting faces to look at. It is very interesting to see the quality special effects and dragons. I love hearing the familiar family names in this origin story. But it's hard to watch because I don't care about the characters. I'm not even sure who the protagonists and antagonists are. Yawn."
"I went in on this point blank. Not expecting GOT. What i did expect is that at least something happened in 4 episodes.What did i watch?A very soft pushover king that has a daughter who doesn't want to marry. Sounds like the bold and the beautiful to me.No action, no fights just conversations about who a girl will marry.How on earth did this man become king? He'll probably let a homeless person take a bite off his sandwich.The characters are just unbelievable. Everyone is so sweet, loving, peaceful and feministic. It just feels fake and wrong in that time.4 hours in and what happened? Nothing.My love for GOT can't save this show. Not watching the 5th one."
"Three episodes of watching this series and my god I am stuck with it. The attention to detail these guys have put and the storytelling is so good I also like that they show can skip years without causing any misunderstanding to the viewers.The casting is great & the costumes were so fine I have a strong feeling that these directors have learnt from the mistakes of Dumb and dumber, if someone enjoyed watching Game of Thrones I really suggest watching this one.a magical miracle"" and a worthy successor to the original series, which became the most Emmy-winning drama of all time. House of the Dragon's premiere marks a strong, well-cast start to the Game of Thrones spinoff. This feels very close to its predecessor in tone and content, but immediately establishes a struggle for power around an amiable, weak-willed king,"
"Whatever your feelings towards season 8 of Game of Thrones, don't victimise this show for the mistakes of another. House of the Dragon is a chance to revive the Game of Thrones IP; not a cash grab or lazy work but everyone behind the scenes is pouring their heart into this project and it is visible on screen. This first season manages to reach the heights of early Game of Thrones - something I thought could not be done.The hardest thing for House of the Dragon was getting fans back into the world of Westeros to give it another chance. The creators of the show knew it would be an uphill battle from the get-go. The first episode was phenomenal and got me hooked straight away. And episodes seemed to only get better and better, ending on a finale that sets up the war to come beautifully.The pacing of the show is one of the strongest things about it; no time is wasted, every scene is vital and pushes the story forward with a building momentum. The events of the story happen over a long period of time and something I was worried about was the time jumps, with actors and actresses changing. But everything is handled so well; of course I'm going to miss Milly Alcock and Emily Carey as Rhaenyra and Alicent, but I have so much faith in Emma D'Arcy and Olivia Cooke who have proved themselves these past 5 episode to carry these characters forward.The main standout of the show is Paddy Considine as Viserys, who is clearly up for an Emmy win. Matt Smith as Daemon was also really great. The acting across the whole cast is great, which helps complement the really well defined characters they each play. The writing and dialogue are all to the highest standard along with the production design, costume design and soundtrack.I had so much fun with this first season and if the quality of storytelling is maintained for the future seasons, this could truly be great."
"Absolutely a banger, good cinematography and great fantasy.actually george martin poured this game of thrones into next level and people should addict this house of dragon as well.valar morgulis."
"I have seen the first 2 episodes. Ep1 seemed like it attempted to grab the attention of GOT fans with some similar, yet less satisfying, scenes. Reminds me of the old records at KMart in the 70's by K-Tel. They had all the years number one hits, but done by an unknown cover band. It also reminds me of Vinyl in another way. The fairly recent HBO flop that looked good on paper but was pure garbage. Ep 2 of HOTD was excruciatingly BAD. Not just boring, but horrific. I could not care any less about any character. It seems they are grooming the 15 year old princess to be the face of the show, but Yikes! Talk about charmless! I predict the same fate as the show Vinyl. Initially planning on a multiple season run, but midway through the first season, they will realize no one cares, and just fade off after the end of season 1."
"This series is way darker, brutal and better than the GOT's 1st season. Dragons are amazing. No words for that. This has a serious potential to be one of the greatest series of all time. I really enjoyed the 1st episode. If you missed this you are so unlucky. Cheers!"
"I got to admit I am pleasantly surprised. I expected nothing and I got a fantasy show with interesting plot, very good character development, really great acting and, well, dragons!As someone who loves fantasy, this show is nice refreshment to the genre. The plot is interesting, it has development, things are set in motion. It is also what one can expect from a show set in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire, brutal, unforgiving, honest in what it wants to tell the audience. The characters are gray, some more than others, they all have good sides and flaws, and their development is really interesting to follow.So far it is great and I hope it will continue to do so."
"This is very strong first episode and much better than I was expecting. Predictably the 'woke' and 'anti-woke' crowds are doing their usual review extremism, so just ignore them.Sure, some of the dragon CGI is strangely bad, and there were some plot and casting decisions that smelled a little too politically correct, but the good outweighs the bad, by a lot. For most of its runtime this feels like a good ol' GoT episode. More narrowly focused perhaps, but it was actually nice to spend a full hour getting to know the new characters."
"The production value is an easy 9.But that's about all it has going for it.It's basically a solo story about young Daenerys Targaryen in another time, without calling it that. (Think baby Yoda that's not baby Yoda, or Mandorlorian that's not Boba Fett, etc. Holding true to contemporary creativity'.) She was never in my top 10 favorite characters from the original.On top of that, it doesn't have any multiple story arcs, no writing to make you love/hate each character, none of Martin's political tongue and cheek, etc.It's GoT - without what made it GoT.Solid Disney-esque money grab by HBO.People will see through it, eventually.LotR: RoP is so bad in comparison - that it's making this project seem better than it really is."
"It's visually beautiful and stunning, as you can see from the various trailers, acting is spectacular and it feels very much like Westeros in the books. Incredibly accurate to the source material, I cannot wait for more. CGI is amazing, dragons look realistic."
"Boring and stiff. It seems we're watching a school play. The king is no king, the queen is a millennial and the princesses are a poor imitation of the Stark sisters.I usually say the actors are not to blame, but here even the actors are weak. And if the writers weren't sleeping, I'm betting the audience is."
"I have no idea how the rating is so high, 5 episodes in and barely anything has happened. Apparently their budget is $20 million per episode, good luck trying to figure out where that has been spent. The characters are boring and uninteresting. Very little violence or nudity, absolutely nothing like GoT, especially not like the early seasons where its non-stop action, whereas with this show I find myself checking my phone out of boredom. If you compare it to GoT you were be severely disappointed. I will keep on watching in the hopes that it gets better but my expectations are very low at this point."
"This is a great piece of television. Writing and characters development is perfect. Directing and score are outstanding. Casting (considering time jumps) is very well done. The performances are undeniable perfect (especially Considine's, Beast's, Alcock's, Smith's, Cooke's and D'Arcy's). Stunning cinematography and visual effects. You don't feel a hole between episodes when there are time jumps. Everything fits. The show keeps alive the atmosphere of Game of Thrones and Westeros, despite having new character, exploring new places and taking place two-hundred years before of the mother-series. Season 1 is perfect. I think, if they keep walking this way, season 2 will be greater."
"The first season was very strong and the strongest episode I saw in the eighth episode , and Viserys presented the character in a very great way""And I liked the last fight that was between the dragons in the ten episode . The visual effects were strong , and each episode was stronger than the second. Damon fight shocked me at the end of the third episode.""I liked Amond courage when he let Vigar serve him, and his sister shocked me. She said that he wouldn't take a dragon without taking his eye, and the son of Rhaenyra took Amond eye.""I was shocked by the death of Viserys and the coup of Alicent against Rhaenyra , and she took the Iron Throne of her son Aegon."
"Wow. Just wow.. Cinematography, dialogues, Cgi, Costumes. The acting. This is so good. The best tv series of 2022 so far. I am inlove with Rhaenyra and her dragon so much. I wish dragons were real lol. Must watch tv. Peak. W."
"I can say for sure that personally i think its great and I am now commited to the story enough to stick around for more and see where they take it. Matt smith and milly alcock are mvp's, although it has flaws its not enough to put out the flame, great start to hopefully a roaring future."
"Note: I will review this show episode by episode, with a short paragraph or so about each episode as I finish it. The overall rating I give to the show will change with each episode I watch and a final verdict being given as I complete the currently 1 available season.I do however strongly disagree with the race swaps that was done for the actors/actresses playing the Velaryons. The Velaryons like the Targaryens come from Valyria though are not dragon riders. The Targaryens and Velaryons aka Valyrians are described as white of hair and pale of skin in the books and as someone who likes a accurate adaptation of books. Though thankfully even these Velaryons still do have white hair. Anyway onto the review!Episode 1 - 8,5/10: A strong start to the show. We are introduced to the main characters that make up the Dance Of Dragons and are given our first looks at the people who will form the Greens and the Blacks.The casting for the most part seems to have been done quiet well with Matt Smith, Paddy Considine and Milly Alcock as King Viserys, Prince Daemon and Princess Rhaenyra respectively. We also get a first look at Syrax and Caraxes and the episode starts to setup for the coming Targaryen civil war.I will however criticize the Aegon Targaryen prophecy about the night game which was not in the books and seems added in purely to make a connection to the Game Of Thrones series and serves as a reminder to the absolute failure the dreaded Night King and long dark was; also known as S8 of Game Of Thrones.Episode 2 - 9/10: A very interesting episode, Daemon is at heads with his brother King Viserys, The Velaryons of Driftmark have been snubbed in favour of the Hightowers of Oldtown and Rhaenyra is trying her best to prove to her father that she will make a strong queen. Unfortunately Viserys is being led down the wrong path by his hand Otto Hightower who wants to see a grandchild of his sit the Iron Throne.Daemon was right last episode when he said the small council all try to sway the king in their own direction while he would stand by his brothers side and protect him. I do think Daemon would also be playing his own game but I also don't believe that Daemon would betray his brother or kill his niece for the throne. Anyway good episode I really liked it and onto the next one!Episode 3 - 8/10: A solid episode, especially the ending when we get to see Daemon at war on the step-stones. He couldn't take it the past 3 years but soon as he hears his brother is sending help he takes it the very next minute. Rhaenyra finally gets to pick her own husband though Viserys is looking worse and worse with the whispers coming in from every direction. The only truly solid advice he got was from Lord Strong.Episode 4 - 7/10: Rhaenyra is a Princess or the realm and heir to the Iron Throne however she is very stubborn and doesn't always make the best decisions. Some of her earlier actions like getting the dragons egg back from Daemon without bloodshed while dangerous was calculated and well executed on her part.However sleeping with her Kings Guard was definitely not a smart move. Knowing what happens next if the series follows the books... all I can say is her kids may ride dragons or wyverns because you know House Of The Dragon only actually has WyvernsðŸ˜‚. But they are not true Targaryens and no one with half a braincell is going to believe Daemon or Laenor is the father when they all have black hair...Anyhow, besides that good episode. Viserys got rid of Otto Hightower at Rhaenyra's urging and I only wish that Rhaenyra took the tea the maester made for her at her fathers urging, unfortunately we all know she ends up with 3 (Not True Born Sons), off who I'm not sure.Episode 5 - 8/10: Things are moving fast, Rhaenyra is to be married to her gay cousin. The king is not looking well and the queen has found out about Rhaenyra's fling with her sworn protector. A good episode, things will soon come to a head and the blacks and greens shall clash. Daemon also got rid of his wife, poor girl. She was quiet pretty and would be a warrior at his side if only they loved one another. Anyway looking forward to episode 6, this episode certainly did a lot of world building and got things to where they needed to be. Plus that was one eventful wedding I got to say.Episode 6 - 8,5/10: A very interesting start with the time-skip to Rhaenyra giving birth to her third and final (Not True Born) son. Very interesting stuff indeed, Ser Harwin being the baby daddy. Viserys refusing to believe it, His hand offering his resignation. Just full of happenings at court this episode was. It's gearing up for the outbreak of the dance of dragons. Seeing Laena dying though was very sad, she still riding Vhagar would have made a massive difference in the fighting rather then having the greens getting their hands on the strongest dragon around. Also really like the older version of Rhaenyra.Episode 7 - 8/10: The sides are starting to form, Rhaenyra and Daemon are married and both their spouses the Velaryon siblings are dead. Though unlike in the books Laenor's death in the show is faked and not real. Solid episode, The greens also got Vhagar now. Without Vhagar it would be an easy black victory even if all the great houses sided with the greens.Episode 8 - 8/10: The king does not have long left, The greens and the blacks are preparing for whats to come. Viserys get's to see his family together one last time. Unfortunately this is the beginning of the end for House Targaryen as nearly all their dragons will die during the dance and much Targaryen blood will be spilled.Episode 9 - 6/10: The absolute ridiculousness of Viserys last word to add some legitimacy to the greens side, added in for the benefit of the show. We all know the blacks are correct and should lead and the dance of the dragons should never have happened if not for the Hightowers greed. Add Lord Strong's foot fetish into the mix and we have a truly weird episode. Besides this a good episode in all other accounts. Though Princess Rhaenys could have solved everything if she had said but one word, ""Dracarys"" and roasted the greens alive at Aegon's coronation.Episode 10 - 10/10: What a ending to the episode! The greens and the blacks are at war, blood has been spilt as one of Rhaenyra's sons was torn into pieces by Vhagar. There is no going back from this and season 2 will be war! What an ending to season 1, I cannot wait to see the Hightower/Targaryen line wiped out so the true Targaryen line minus Rhaenyra's (Not True Born Sons) can continue to rule. The only sad part is there won't be much dragons left either and with it withers House Targaryen's power.Overall a solid 8/10 from me for now!"
"It is quite gutsy to follow up with a show in George R. R. Martin's universe after the disastrous last season of GOT. House of the Dragon had a great premiere and first episode. It set the scene well and drummed up enough interest and intrigue in this time in the kingdom. However I feel the rest of the season has been a mixed bag.The pacing has been an issue for me. The show progressed at a snails pace and then suddenly you have a flurry of action that did not deliver a payoff. You had too many unnecessary scenes and dialogue that felt like it served no purpose. To those viewers who rate episodes 9s and 10s, can you honestly name all the characters and articulate the purpose of those conversations or hidden meaning?Hidden meaning brings me to my second point. Is there any deep or hidden meaning? House of the Dragon reminds me of Season 7 of GOT. There is quality content scattered here and then the majority of it is filled with dialogue and extra scenes that could easily be omitted. The depth, intrigue and high quality that once made GOT a huge success is not present so far. At the beginning GOT took some time to lay its foundations and carefully weave storylines. House of the Dragon assumes we know and more importantly will care for the characters and events. No, that needs to be earned with good pacing and scene setting. For example, Otto Hightower. Why is he the Hand? How did he rise to power? A few scenes showing his background and even that of the small council and other characters. It is the Why aspect that is not fully explored and fleshed out.For these reasons and gaps this show rates as a 7/10 for me now. But I would be only too happy to revisit this review and increase the rating if things pick up in quality and content."
"To be honest, some of these reviews are way too low. The acting was good, the wigs are good, the music is nostalgic and the cgi and scenery is as good as Game of Thrones.It's obviously going to be different than Game of Thrones so there's no point in making constant comparisons between the two, you're only going to be disappointed if you're doing this.Sure, there were bits and pieces throughout the first episode that had me a bit bored, but overall I think it was a good start and it has a promising storyline to come.So, I think that all of these low reviews are just people raising their expectations in hopes that it will be exactly like Game of Thrones, but it obviously falls short. Of course it's not going to be the same, it's 170 years BEFORE that show, so don't be stupid."
"The show skips over much of the character development to basically highlight interesting points like a history book. The major time jump didn't bother me, the new actors are well casted but I was hoping they would let us live with them longer, get to know them and actually flow through the story how game of thrones does. Instead we time jump so much in this show that I feel very disconnected from the characters. All of Allison's children along with Rhaenyra's are so difficult to connect to because you can't know someone from a couple scenes In an episode and jump to them being teenagers. It just feels lazyI have read the book and understand that this is the format but this format doesn't work for good television."
"In over 10 hours of content nothing happens. We see the same scenes repeated over and over again simply with different characters and or the same at different ages.Scene type 1 - ""You must remember your duty""Scene type 2 - ""We're going to threaten each other without any actual consequences or actions taking place""Scene type 3 - Throne room discussion/ mini slaughter/F'ing about.Scene type 4 - Stand in the middle of the bridge near Dragon stone and discuss with/threaten each other.Scene type 5 - Insignificant scene that pretends to be character development but ultimately means absolutely nothing. ( for example Larys Strong foot fetish scene, like wtf does this add? We already know he's an evil s**t cus they keeping hammering it into you like a rusty broken nail, for the small amount of screen time he actually has)These scenes repeated from EP1 - EP10 over and over again.House of the Dragon wishes you to believe something important is happening or going to happen but by the end it's simply no more than continuous setup and that's being generous. I was waiting for something actually important to happen and it never did. Scenes were included which amount to nothing while scenes which could have been interesting like Damon's adventures with the Triarchy or some actual character development simply don't appear, for some bewildering reason.Who am I supposed to root for here? Every character (except perhaps Paddy Considine's, not due to good writing tho) is a horrible, fickle, uninteresting mess and don't hold even a speck of light to GoT's roster of clearly defined, developed and likable and unlikable characters, each and everyone is fully rounded and fleshed out, even the small appearances have more character than any that appear here.I can't imagine how boring this series must have been to read and perform for all the actors involved. Turn up to set do the same scenes you did yesterday and the day before again and again, and it shows, everyone looks bored af.Locations and world-building are non-existent, again repeating the same sets and locals over and over with nothing new or interesting we haven't already seen depicted much better in GoT.And they even include stupid dialogue eluding to the White Walkers which is totally irrelevant as it won't happen for over 100 years in their time, why on earth even mention it? It's has nothing to do with the ""Story"" and has already been concluded whether you believe it was done well or not it is not this shows job to make up for it.The music despite being composed by the same person is boring, forgettable and lazy. They didn't even bother to come up with a new theme. Like what? There's one motif that stands out which is used every now and then over scenes without any coherence or thematic consistency, the rest is completely drab.Just a lazy, boring, uneventful see-through parody of Game of Thrones. Something better actually happen in series 2 because if it doesn't then this entire franchise has no reason to exist."
"I watched the first episode of the House of the Dragon and I found this series to be rather boring. However, I kept on watching this series and I am now loving it.Rhaenyra is a true DIVA and she doesn't care what most think of her with the exception of her deceitful stepmother, Queen, Alicent Hightower.The Velaryon family were the first to control Dragons using magic, and rode dragons for a millennia. It was interesting to find out, Laenor Velaryon is gay and he has to marry Rhaenyra. I knew they had to throw in some type of homosexual character, however, homosexuality goes back to the days of Sodom & Gomorrah.I am glad to know, Emma D'Arcy and Olivia Cooke will officially make their debut as the adult versions of the lead characters in House of the Dragon in episode 6. John MacMillian will play the adult Laenor Velaryon. I felt the younger characters were too young to play some of the sexual scene. Now as adults, anything goes. I can't wait to see the House of the Dragon weekly on HBO-Max. Episodes premiere early on HBO-Max than HBO. I am glad, I have both to watch on my new 2022 Samsung S95B OLED 4K 65 inch Smart Television. LOL."
"Though some episodes feel like slow filler, the show is super enjoyable and jam-packed with shocking moments, twists and an outstanding performance from the cast! Episodes three, nine and eight are standouts for me.Everything the other fantasy show that's running now is not. The writing is good, the characters motivations and actions line up! (incredible that this is praiseworthy, but the current state of fantasy TV-shows is horrendous). The CGI is not overused (also a rarity these days) and when its used it looks good. There is a lot of good to be said about this show, but the most important fact is this: They clearly tried to make a good and entertaining show, instead of making a badly written parable of modern society and telling the viewers how they are a bigots if they don't like it. All in all, well written, entertaining believable portrayal of characters. Definitely worth a watch!!"
"I loved GOT. I loved the books too. This show is dull. I really wanted to like it but so far I have to force myself to watch it. Also, the subtext of 'girls can do anything boys do' ruins the show. I feel like I already know what's going to happen. It makes all the characters seem flat and one sided. Instead of letting the story develop organically it feels forced like it has an agenda. GOT had strong female characters but they don't feel forced like this, they felt like real people. The show starts with some pretty involved politics in the beginning which feels like a lot to sludge through when you don't know any of the characters yet. I really hope the show gets better. So far I just don't care about any of the characters or anything going on in the show."
"I like this series a lot but one thing that bother me and ruin the experience is the re-cast, trying to fit the characters aging better to the events. I think the feeling you get for the characters diminish a lot when doing this and I dont see any benefits. Also they hand picked what characters that was re casted so I mean true to the series Cristan Cole didnt age a bit in 10 years. Why didnt they do make up or hair like they did to the King if they wanted the cast to look aged, and still be able to use the same cast that we got attached too. Shame because now its starting to happen things and the build up is done but all the sudden some main characters as well."
"First off, LOL at all the people already comparing this to Game of Thrones. We literally got through the first two episodes and people are saying that it doesn't live up to GoT. It takes time to establish a story line and introduce characters. For everyone saying that the characters lack depth, GIVE IT TIME! This show is in its infancy and people are already writing it off, mind blowing.My only issue so far with the show is that I get the sense that they are recycling character traits. They are trying too hard to recreate the magic formula that got us all hooked on GoT characters in the first place. I hope I am wrong and these characters form a different arc over time but we shall see. I have not read any of the books so this is only my take from watching the shows. For instance:-Daemon Targaryen= Jaime Lannister. (the duality of man; has both great qualities and terrible qualities. Comes off as a bad guy but is really good deep down.)-Rhaenyra Targaryen= A mix of Arya with a little Daenarys ( the female that no one takes seriously at first but proves herself to everyone and becomes a hardcore warrior.)-Alicent Hightower= Sansa Stark (The pretty naive flower that gets used as a pawn for other people but becomes strong herself in other ways).-Ser Criston Cole= John Snow (the quiet warrior that always does the right thing and makes it impossible not to like him. Just an all around good guy).There are a few more character connections I saw but don't feel like adding all of them. I would say that the first two episodes of House of the Dragon are at about an 8.2-8.5. I have faith that as the season goes on and as the series gets more seasons it will definitely be on Game of Throne levels. And like I said earlier, I hope that these characters take on a life of their own rather than feel like recycled formulas."
"Making a prequel or a spin-off of a show such as Game of Thrones I can only guess that can be as exciting as terrifying, being one of the most popular shows ever all audiences around the globe are rubbing their hands to both show their love or hate depending on how the end project turns out to be.Personally, I see great potential and I believe you need to look at it with the right expectations; first it cannot be as Game of Thrones at all simply because we are following a story arc for one single family that is part of the saga, whereas the original series showcased all sort of side plots, houses and story lines, so the scale can't be comparable.Also, the first time I saw Game of Thrones it wasn't an instantly mind-blowing series, it also started with great potential and slowly evolved into the epic series it's considered to be (a part for the catastrophic conclusion).Due to the huge budget the show had they made one thing far better than the original, special effects, House of the Dragon surpasses many feature films in this department with stunning visuals and cinematography, some of the battle sequences as well as the fighting scenes are also spectacular.The characters might still not be as interesting as the GoT ones but as the show progressed, I was impressed with Paddy's performance as the King Viserys, I actually felt his pain, for the types of characters this series has gotten us used to it was refreshing seeing him.One thing I do agree on the criticism is that Rhaenyra, which the show clearly intends to portray has one of fan favorites, does seem to lose a bit of charisma and intensity that her young self showed, this might be purposefully done considering how the season ends, hence my current approach being on the potential aspect and there is a lot of developments for the next seasons that are critical to see how the series turns out to be."
"I've been cautiously optimistic about HBO's House of the Dragon for a while now. With good writing and George R. R. Martin's significant involvement, it wouldn't really matter if people were soured on the ending of Game of Thrones; this show still had the potential to deliver some of the GoT excellence the show was known for. In HotD's first episode ""The Heirs of the Dragon,"" the series has already laid the groundwork for that excellence with perhaps the best first hour of television I could have asked for.People worried about the pre-release stills need not have. The characters look wonderful, the sets look beautiful, and the world already looks lived in and real. Creator Ryan J. Condal does a fine job setting up the conflict and the major players we will see in it this season. Veteran Game of Thrones director Miguel Sapochnik delivers strikingly beautiful and at times brutal scenes. He's known for his epic action set pieces such as those in ""Battle of the B*stards"" and ""Hardhome"" but also in this episode he proves to be an expert at crafting subtle and tense political intrigue between some already interesting and complex characters.In one episode Condal and Sapochnik have already created a compelling ensemble and virtually the entire cast deliver great performances. I have to give props to Paddy Considine and Matt Smith, but Rhys Ifans' portrayal of Otto Hightower might be my sleeper favorite. Milly Alcock and Emily Carey are great as the Hand's daughter and the Princess and heir, respectively. I already want to see more of the two father-daughter relationships they've established here early. Finally, I have to give credit to guest star Sian Brooke for her heartbreaking performance as the Queen consort. Her child birthing scene juxtaposed with the brutal jousting and fighting at the Hand's tourney made for some of the most chilling moments we've seen yet in the Game of Thrones universe.I know this review is long, but I just have so much to say already, and I'll end with this: Of all the things we got to enjoy in this first episode, the big reveal of the now-confirmed fan theory of the Song of Ice and Fire has to be the biggest. The knowledge that Targaryen kings pass down the secret of Aegon the Conqueror's vision of the Doom of Man, foretelling the White Walkers and The Long Night, has huge implications not only for this show but certainly for GRRM's book series as well (if he ever gets around to finishing them). This reveal gives the future of the Targaryen dynasty an even more foreboding outlook; this secret has been passed down the line of succession, but the civil war, betrayal, and thirst for power that is sure to come puts this most important knowledge in danger. It almost makes it even more of a shame knowing how Game of Thrones ultimately handled its resolution, but for how good of a start ""Heirs of the Dragon"" was, maybe it doesn't matter so much. Either way, House of the Dragon is shaping up to be a most compelling tale of violence and tragedy that serves to expand the world of Westeros to a new level. Strap in."
"As usual, this show is not nearly as bad as the 1 star raters say nor as ""amazing"" as the 10 star folks say it is. I read the book on which this was based, as I had read Martin's original Song of Ice And Fire a many years before HBO made it into a series. Very similar in the way they are laying groundwork and cut to the chase and streamlined many characters and houses so that it's easier to follow. This was a good first episode they can build on. Give it a shot and see how it plays out. So far, so good."
"This show lacks main success elements. The weak story build up, frail charachters arches, and the aborted side story lines make the show flat and unrelatable to the ""expecting alot"" GOT audience.The whole ""show don't tell"" concept went in the drainage with most of the story is being told by the charachters instead of acted.Many charachters appeared doing major things and disappeared with no particular ligic behind it.Comparing this to GOT is unfair, because except for the visuals and some common elements they actually almost have nothing in common in essence.The visuals and effects are beautiful."
"As a fan on GOT I must say that this is quite boring unless you are excited by endless political wranglings over the heir to a throne. The main actors are great but they have nothing to work with. There aren't enough story devices or character arcs. I imagine that GOT virgins would find it very hard to get through. There may be better and more engaging events in the horizon but they have done an awful job of hooking the viewer in the first three episodes, with too much exposition and dreary dialogue, no main protagonist or danger. Lavish production but pretty empty story that is very slow and ponderous."
"I have just watched all 10 episodes over 3 days and I must say it was better than I thought itnwould be. I watched GOT over 2 months last year and the bonus was I didn't need to wait for the next episode as it got hooked. Gutted I only have 1 series of this and am looking forward to second series . Defo worth a watch if your not sure. It paints the picture of what's to come in GOT and the hightowers are like the lannisters in that they would sell their souls for the throne. Just shows that having a relationship with your siblings is never advisable when it c9mes to bearing healthy children , hopefully series 2 isn't too far away as it looks like it could be a good one."
House of the Dragon (Season 1)
Creator: Ryan Condal and George R. R. Martin
"Rating: 8/10House of Dragon is a prequel to the beloved Game of Thrones franchise after the disappointing last two seasons of the series. With House of Dragons, we were being reintroduced to the dynasty of the Targaryen and their fight to keep the throne.The whole series started out slow and the constant time jumps were jarring. However, the show was able to capture the interests of the audience through characterization. The performances were great, with Matt Smith delivering a captivating and subtle performance standout and playing into the impulsive eruptions of violence that the Game of Thrones franchise is known for. But, it was Paddy Considine's performance that catapulted throughout the season. He gave out a rare and beautifully rendered portrayal of a wise and stoic King Viserys, and it was in episode 8 that he delivered a most devastating swan-song performance.House of Dragon may not be as great as its predecessor, however, the constant narrative pacing and characterization allowed the show to succeed on its own distinctions. The characters are well-established and well-written and we get to discover the characters we love and the characters we love to hate. High production values are reflected in the series, and the cinematography and atmospheric soundtrack are fetched together masterfully.House of Dragon does not contain much violence and cruelty like the GoT has but incest. However, the goal of the series was to build anticipation and it was strongly achieved. It is a very promising series and a lot to look forward to in the next season. Another concern is that we have to wait for 2 years for the next season, I am not sure if some of us are still alive by then.Nevertheless, as a fan of the franchise, House of Dragon has established its story satisfactorily and it is starting to construct the suspense of greater things to happen."
There was a moment in Episode 8 that really hit me in the heart. As a father the tears of your daughter crying out for your help Will literally make you fight off death. When the doors opened it was a deeply emotional moment and powerful expression of love. No matter what our children do we will love them and try to protect them until our last breath. It was a combination of his greatly deteriorating health when we see him at the beginning of the episode. The masterful performance by Considine of the constant pain both emotional and physical. The realization of a final desperate attempt to make his mark on his family was fantastically captured.
"As a standalone series this is good if not the best but it is not Game of Thrones. Since this is from the same world it is obvious that we compare. GOT S1 vs HOTD S1. From the very first episode GOT has set the game that it is not your conventional TV show I mean come on no one guessed that someone could push a child to save their arse. An element of surprise which HOTD lacks unprecedented consequence like Sansa losing Nimeria. Ned stark ? Dont tell me you saw that coming. Vast storylines with unique characters and personalities which HOTD lacks.HOTD lacks that element of surprise, you can always guess whats gonna happen even Lucerys fate in the finale. Nobody cared for Lucerys anyways. Almost all characters deaths were not impactful as they were never really explored. Im not talking about Viserys he died of disease it was long time coming.Very few unique characters like Viserys stands out so does queen Alicent, Rhaeneyra and Daemon. May be otto as well but rest are bland. Viserys should get an emmy for his amazing performance. The kids are awful I cant decide who is who such poor charecterization. The show is too dark I mean visually, will be difficult to binge lacks the fun element also. But if you dont compare it with GOT its a good show. The show runners went with a more hollywood style cinematic approach. You can feel that they went for style for eg when Rhaenys fled to get her dragon during Aegon swearing in she had time to find the dragon as well as armor, the dragon broke the roof while she was sitting and she did not break sweat not even dust on her face. There was no wood or iron supporting such large roof strange or its just they forgot logic. What is it with the episodes where dragon does anything its rated high ?The whole season felt like a build up for something which never happened. No other kingdoms were explored. I get it its the Dance of the dragons but the role of other kingdoms should have been explored to a certain degree. So I am little disappointed but hey its not a bad show its a very good show but my hopes were sky high. There were some amazing scenes like Family dinner scene with Viserys emotional speech, Alicent trying to convince otto to not kill Rhaenerya, Laena after Funeral scene, Viserys convincing Rhanerya why she ll always be his heir etc etc. It had some amazing character moments in almost all the episodes none of the episodes were boring mind you but nothing wow happens either so I ll rate it at 8.5 for first season. Stop getting hyped for dragons."
This is the worst casting possible. Not one character from the young version looks anything like the older versions. The princess was so beautiful and literally the older version looks like a man. She's literally disgusting looking. How does that make sense at all. Her nose is gigantic too and the princess had a little button nose. Prince Laenor looks nothing like the younger version what so ever. This is insane. Whoever did casting should be fired. The older versions act horribly. Zero talent. The young versions were amazing. The queen looks nothing like the younger version. This is ridiculous. It started out so good and all of that was taken away. You should have made the younger characters just look older. So disappointed. The most with the princess. Like seriously what is wrong with you. How can I stare at that ugly face on my screen for a hour each week. Not happening.
"After the dumpsterfire of the ending GoT had i had very less expectations for HotD but it delivered to its mark and beyond. The dragons, the characters and their actors. Especially Steve Toussaint was incredible as Corlys Velaryon. The work put into this can be seen and hopefully with time the ending of Game Of Thrones can be forgotten."
"I'm having a hard time caring about any of these characters and I'm 4 episodes in now. With GOT I was immediately connecting with the characters. This show is missing emotion and its missing strong sub plots. The character development is weak so far. I hope they are just laying the groundwork and it gets better but GOT was immediately engaging. House of Dragons already has the blueprint why not just follow it and improve on that. This family feud is dragging and it's not as interesting as the writers think it is. The dialogue is seriously lacking. Where is the wit and backbiting, and clever insults? I read that HOD has already been renewed for a second season. I am determined to stay the course and finish season 1, and if I am not satisfied, I'll be done with the series altogether."
"Top notch writing. I am head over heels for this show. Its intellectual and respects the audience. I could not be more invested in the show and its characters. I pity people who do not see the intense action and drama here as I see people complaining it's boring or people wanting battles. This is an adult's show spanning generations. Love, loss, family, jealousy, immaturity, maturity, and moments that have made me gasp, tear and chear from even simple character gestures. What an achievement. The show will be celebrated for some of the most wonderfully done recent media. Congrats to all involved with making this show what it is."
"You gotta love the way aging works in this series. If you were an adult in episode one, you never age a day in over 20 years. UNLESS you're the king, who looks more and more like an extra pulled from a Walking Dead set every episode. Dude was on death's door for years! (Leeching has yet to fix holes in the head) If you were a teen, you become a totally different person arbitrarily between episodes and your chemistry with others is now altered completely.In a vacuum, this show is not bad, it's even fairly good. Unfortunately, it's using the GOT name, and fair or not, comparisons will be made. This is just a smaller show. In every way. The world, the acting and actors, the brilliant dialogue, the plans within plans within plans, the memorable quotes (that become a part of pop culture) and even the twists are just smaller. Less than the original. It lacks the magical feeling of excitement each episode inspired, waiting in anticipation for a week to find out what happens next.I would say this has more of a Shakespeare Hamlet vibe than the first GOT. That's not a bad thing. It's just not great. And when you catch lighting in a bottle the way the original did, rarely (if ever) is it caught again."
"I keep trying to be patient hoping it will kick off. My patience is wearing quite thin. I am 6 episodes in at the time of writing this review. At this point I would be pretty surprised if this wasn't just their intentional format.What is that format? An extremely boring generic drama/soap opera that is set in the GoT universe. It's all about royal politics and interpersonal drama. There is very little in the way of actual action, or thrills of any kind. Every once in a while they throw you a bone or make it seem like it might actually take off. For example, episode 5 ended on a note that suggested something interesting might finally take hold, until episode 6 came along and it skipped time to a future date where it was business as usual again. I am guessing the interesting bits must have happened in between those times.It has none of the light hearted comedic relief moments or witty dialogue of the original series. It has no interesting sub-plots, or even remotely interesting characters like the original did. The pacing of the original series was slow at times, but it was actually masterfully done. In the end it was always just the right pacing that left you with more details and suspense (up until the final season that is where they jammed it all in and ruined it of course). This one is glacially paced and goes nowhere at any point in time.If your interest in a show would be something along the lines of a soap opera that was in a royal setting but also the GoT universe then you will not be disappointed. If instead you want a thriller, or action, or story driven content that goes somewhere, you will be very disappointed.It's bland, one dimensional, the characters are hollow and uninteresting, and if there is ever even a hint of it becoming more than that, it will only be a jest. It honestly gets worse with every episode. The only positives would be the CGI/environmental designs etc. (although CGI is a little off here and there too). As usual costume, and set designers knock it out of the park here. It's just a shame they are wasting their time and efforts doing it for such a bland, uninteresting story.The 3 in my 3/10 review is merely for the costume/set designers etc. The rest is 0/10."
"Game of Thrones started an era in television that no other series can surpass. With HOTD, a new era has begun.HOTD is dark, brutal and spine-chilling from the very start. A prequel that carries the essence of Game of Thrones but is different in its own unique way.If you had any doubts for this prequel, just watch the first episode."
"This is an amazing show that takes some of my favorite aspects of Game of Thrones, and builds up on them in a magnificent way. Dialogue is great, cinematography and visual effects are stunning. It is a faithful adaptation that book readers will love. Fantastic first episode that makes me exited for more. It's great to be back in Westeros."
"Given all the recent franchise disappointments of the last few years, I wasn't expecting much. But, for the first time in a decade, my low expectations were actually proven wrong. It took only a few minutes for the show to actually bring out a real emotional response. It was like I'd been whisked back to 2011, to a time when stories could be told that weren't just political nagging and power fantasies, but actual experiences.So, how good is it? I would say somewhere between the early seasons of Game of Thrones and Rome (2005). The actors do a terrific job and the writing is at a very high quality. Just like in GoT the first couple of episodes are spent establishing the characters and the intrigue, but one cannot downplay how important that is. House of the Dragon, based on the first couple of episodes, is doing a good job of laying the groundword for what is shaping up to be an engaging story.The costuming is high quality, the sets as well. A perfect recapture of the visuals of GoT, and the only little nitpicks I have for the visuals is that the Valyrian-blooded characters still don't have purple eyes, and the CGI for the dragons looks slightly dated. But, obviously, if I were in charge of the visuals, I would hope for any complaints to be as small as these.Last, but not least, the music. 10/10. A familiar score to any fans of GoT and expertly used to amplify emotion in scenes.HBO proves that despite the dip in quality of GoT towards the end, they still have the talent, they still have the passion, and they still have the vision to tell a good story. They say that you can't catch lightning in a bottle twice, but if this show can keep this level up for at least a couple of seasons, they might have done just that."
"Wow. Just wow.. Cinematography, dialogues, Cgi, Costumes. The acting. This is so good. The best tv series of 2022 so far. I am inlove with Rhaenyra and her dragon so much. I wish dragons were real lol. Must watch tv. Peak it's the masterpiece."
"This is based on the first two episodes. I am already in love with this show. Truly fantastic and off to a better start than Game of Thrones. As a huge fan of GoT I will say that like many people I was massively disappointed with how that show finished and rushed many story lines so I hope that doesn't happen again with HOT-D.Now I am hesitant to say it is better than Game of Thrones this early, but I will say that it has started stronger. GoT started much slower. We waited years to see dragons and much of the brutality it became known for. Not the case with HOT-D. After about 20-30 minutes you are thrown right in. Dragons, violence, sex.. it is epic in every way. So so good and the performances are also amazing.The only minor complaint I have to this point is that the show needs a Tyrion. By that I mean it needs a loveable comic relief character that you want to root for. It is far too early say if that will come later, but right now I feel it needs that to break up all the seriousness going on.That's all for now. Might adjust rating in future one way or another, but so far it is better than expected."
"HOTD is the best series going on right now. People saying there's no character development are definitely not paying attention when there's a variety of character development going on in every scene.In a fantasy world of dragons, it's still grounded and has logic (unlike some other fantasy show). You feel the struggle and the pain that these characters go through. And it's only the beginning. We haven't even got to the best parts yet (as a book reader).HOTD has good & sound politics, and can carry itself without too much war or spectular images. The cast are great, Smith is cunning & Alcock is doing a great job showing a discontent typical teenager. I also love the actor playing the king. His facial expression is top notch.Mark my word. This show is only gonna get better."
"Full season edit: 7/10I ended up liking the show more than I thought I would. It started to hit its stride by episode 7. I was invested in the characters by the end and looked forward to each Sunday.I was not a fan of the character changes and time jumps at all. This could've been better handled with flashbacks or dialogue. Changing the actress for Rhaenyra was a travesty, you could've easily de-aged Emma, or aged Milly. Both are great actresses, but this change was too jarring and nonsensical.Some great characters this season, Vicerys is top of the list. Dragon CGI improved by the end as well.Still no GoT, but happy to be back in this world!HBO, please explain why there will be more than a years wait for season 2? Possibly two years isn't acceptable at all. GoT season 2 was one year after season one and it was a lot more riskier at that time.Episode one review 5/10First off, never met a prequel that I liked better than the original, this is no different. Half the suspense is gone before you start. Why would I care anything about the Targaryen's knowing the fate of their family? Maybe if Daenerys story had a different outcome, perhaps I'd be more invested in her family and their history.Secondly, comparing episode one of GoT and ep1 of HotD, I can easily say GoT was light years better. It had stronger characters with way more personality, several exciting storylines that got started within an hour, and to touch on the first point - the excitement of the unknown.I found the CGI to be a bit lesser than what we saw in GoT - which really is not acceptable. The entire colour palette of this show is quite dreary and unremarkable.This would've been a below average episode during the first half of the original GoT series. Season 8 destroyed my passion for this World and this episode did not revive it."
"House of the Dragon (2022-) is a series that I recently finished on HBOMAX. The storyline takes place hundreds of years prior to Game of Thrones when the iron throne is ruled by the House of Dragons. It's very apparent the only way they can lose the throne is if they self implode as a family. When the king is struggling to have boys and his wife dies in child birth a crack of weakness emerges in the family. A woman is appointed the next ruler for the first time ever. People try to coarse the king into what they think is best which will fracture his relationship with his children and brother.This series was created by Ryan J. Condal (Hercules & Rampage) and stars Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Matt Smith (Morbius), Graham McTavish (The Hobbit), Eve Best (The King's Speech), Olivia Cooke (Ready Player One) and Milly Alcock (Upright)The storyline for this is very impressive and intricate and the subplots within the family are perfectly told. The way they spanned the plot across multiple time periods was impressive and well done. I enjoyed how they depicted the children aging and the effects on the parents. The king's nature and impact on the family is very transparent and fits perfectly with how the events unfold. There are some amazing and breathtaking action scenes that are intense and perfectly executed. The dragons are stunning and the ending is absolutely perfect.Overall, this is a fantastic addition to the fantasy genre that was better than the last season of Game of Thrones by a mile. I would score this a 9.5/10 and strongly recommend it."
"Wish I could be more supportive, but really do not think this is anywhere close to the Game of Thrones. Brilliant production values as you would hope and expect, a massive effort by all is certainly acknowledged, and a fine cast to try and emulate the original, but for me, in comparison, it hasn't truly succeeded. The storyline isn't as enthralling, the characters have not the same hook, the constant leaping forward 10 years and 6 years and.... Just annoying. The Dragons are a minor point, and wasted. It is just individuals with ambition and the backstabbing that goes with it. Plenty of that with GoT, but that had so much more. And nowhere near the threat and battles that GoT had. Maybe series 2 will be better...."
"Have been disappointed when watched those episodes 3,4,5 and totally lost my interest after 6 episode.Absolutely confusing, all episode i had a feeling that I have missed previous part, at one point even stoped and tried to watch episode 5, as I was confident that I missed it!Unfortunately I didn't !I do have a great taste that suits everyone same as collection of the favourite movies and series.Actors that been chosen on 6 episode wasn't acting well, I know that they not bad actors but it is clearly filmed in a rush. Important points from episode 1 totally missed and have been forgotten.I don't think that you can Wright a book that based on a last 5 episodes."
Just watched the first episode of HOTD and all I can say is this show is going to be the next big thing in TV drama history.Everything was on point from cinematography to acting.
"GoT was great because of character development. It focused on many different characters and with complex character arcs. The characters so far in this show seem one dimensional and the situations they put the characters in seem contrived, almost like they are trying to force to much into the plot without proper setup. If you don't build the characters up and make the viewers like them, hate them or feel anything towards them then no one will care when they die. Almost feels like there are no stakes in the show. I think part of that lack of connection comes from the shows timeline fast forwarding from one episode to the next. We don't get to see characters deal with the emotions that would naturally occur after certain events, how are we supposed to connect with them if we don't get to see them struggling?"
Promising show waiting for moreðŸ’¥. I feel excited just like when I was watching GOT. This is a masterpiece the making and the cast. This is one of my favourite TV shows now. I advice people to watch game of thrones first because we need to understand the houses of the game of thrones world.
"There a lot of reviews that are hating on this opening episode. I believe this is because people watched 8+ seasons of Game of Thrones, and have completely forgotten what it was like to watch Season 1 Episode 1 without any knowledge of what was coming. People are expecting fully developed, interesting characters and lots of meaningful dialog. This was what people came to expect after watching so many hours of GoT. It's important to remember this is a new show, with new characters. It's not a ripoff in my opinion based on the direction of the show. It's quite different, actually. In my opinion there at least 8 characters that will be very intriguing..( especially some that have not seen the screen, but have been spoken about)... the score is perfect, the quality of set and writing is excellent.I can see why people who have had the privilege of seeing 4 episodes believe that this could live up to GoT. Very impressed through 1 episode. Will rank at end of season."
"The show itself as stand alone is not that bad, but is ruined by mediocre actors, average CGI and as told many times by now, bad wigs. Not to mention some casting choices that follow a certain agenda and does not fit the general picture.Review made after watching the first episode, let's see how it goes. Oh, and the use of the original soundtrack when credits ended was a dirty cheap trick."
"Ahh I've read all the books and was generally excited when come to know how much Mr GRR Martin will be involved.I was not disappointed good script, solid dialogue and good CGI. The pace of the show is ideal there are no boring scenes, characters are slowly built up in detail. CGI is not annoying and at no point central. The show keeps the rough medieval brutality that we know from GOT series and Mr GRR Martin's books.If you are a fan you know the story but still nicely shown and told - minimal cringe and great cast.Feels nice to be back to Westeros and it's nice that the show builds up on an already familiar world.So much better than unfortunate Amazon contender."
"There's been so much hype around this but I went in with relatively lower expectations. After watching the premiere I'm not sure how to feel about it because it's just one episode after all. Off to a slow start but so was Game Of Thrones. The production and acting pedigree is so far on par with the original, and with such a vast world and source material to base the series on I'm hoping the first season is a success so that the show can explore all the history and areas GOT couldn't. I like how it starts out like it's own independent series, introducing us to the world it's based on instead of throwing us in into the thick of things hoping viewers have preceding knowledge from the series it's based on. I hate how many times I've already mentioned game of thrones but it is very reminiscent of it, the breathtaking scenery, gory fights and duels, the politics and it seems the licentious tastes too will continue on in the prequel. As glad as I am to see similar traits I also hopes it creates it's on identity to set it apart. I am scared people will want it to live up to the Game of thrones name, maybe judge it too harshly too early in the process but hope it has a successful run. It is very promising."
This show is nowhere near as good as GOT. I think diehard GOT fans are in denial and trying to wish this show to be great. I remember watching Game of Thrones the first episode and immediately I was hooked. The cast and the story were fantastic. I hate the casting in this new version and episode six was sort of the last straw for me. It was dead boring. I am disappointed in this and other spinoff shows this year like Rings of Power. I am hoping Avatar 2 doesn't fail as bad to recapture the old magic these new streaming shows have failed. I have a feeling these channels like HBO and Amazon will think twice before investing so much into sequels.
"After the utter disappointment of GoT S8, I could not fathom HBO would come back with an actually heartfelt, nerve wracking, loyal to GRRM, nail biting masterpiece. If you find yourself bored in the first 4 episodes (minus the battle at Stepstones, if you find that one boring, you have issues), ride it through to the time-skip.Emma D'Arcy made me cry. Matt Smith gave me goosebumps. And I can already see that Emmy being carved by fire and blood. I am genuinely grateful to finally be able to state again that I can't wait for the next season. The finale was on par to be one of the best season finales I have ever seen growing up in the golden age of TV.Yes, I do miss the Starks. But we will get Winterfell in S2 for sure, fret not. And I never imagined I'd root this hard for a Targaryen ever again."
This is how it shoud be. More darkness and more blood. They developed the whole goddamn characters ver perfectly. Starting Rhaenyra she is the one who need a love and a respect. The way the writers wrote her character is perfectly balanced and it empowers the whole series. Daemon is the one character who never ever give up and he'll achieve anything at any cost perfectly written. Viserys is a KIng which the House of the Dragons and many clans will remember. Alicent Hightower is a sweetest character that it starts and ended with a strong Antagonist. Visuals and Background score are very improved and powered. Team Black Forever. HAIL JON SNOW.
"This is so bland and generic. It looks like they are trying to recapture the magic of GOT seasons 1 through 4, and it fails to ignite any spark in me that has long since been extinguished for this property.The nudity in this seems so contrived, and out of place, in the show simply to try to appeal to the young male demographic.The story is so very predictable even after one episode. If this is the best writing GRR Martin has left in him, perhaps he should retire, and swim in his money bin."
"Give it the time to navigate for the real plot.. don't compare it with GOT as it is the story of 7 kingdoms which is more focused on Stark's, Targayrean's and Lannister's which had more number of characters and the diversity to explore and moreover the setup for the 1st season of GOT was too weak that later progressed with further seasons to become.. While HOTD is predominately about Targaryen's and how in itself has setup it's destruction for such a powerful house.. As far as I can see all build and the fast forward is to lead the story into one of biggest plot and the plots to follow. It is very promising the way it's building to that point where it will be in line for quality and standards of GOT.."
"I don't know why people compare it to GOT? There will not be anything like GOT, because it's about the story, which nothing else will have similar story like GOT!, so please don't comaire them, the two series will be compared in (Cinematography, dialogues, the quality of the materials used, the details, the similarities with the main novel, and every other things we can compare with!)And here is the first episode, it was so bloody, cinematography was amazing, the dragons looks so real, the dialogues, the story, the actors, they are all amazing, and it will be a great serie on it's own!, not compared to other series!.So just be fair and give it a chance."
"I see that the overall ratings are above an 8. I don't know if everyone was watching the same thing that I just watched. The story line jumped, there was almost zero character development, the actors phoned their lines in, the CGI was awful. I have held onto my HBO subscription, waiting for this show. Now I can let it go and save a few bucks. Thank you for helping me."
"Plays like a side quest to a game you used to really enjoy, and you revisit the ""lite"" version for a bit of nostalgia whilst waiting for the next big thing. Lacking in so many of the qualities that made GOT compelling, it's hard to see a good reason for this to last long.Perhaps it will pick up over time, but so far appears to be little more than ""B"" versions of previous characters arguing over trivialities. There's only so much talking heads around tables can keep you entertained. Eventually the heavy handed growling and posturing grows tiresome. Perhaps it is the source material that is at fault but better choices would have elevated this beyond the sense that we are attending a lengthy meeting to discuss things that will be interesting at a later date. Just not any time soon."
"Not a single character has a goal, a weak LITERALLY p*dophilic, excuse of a show. To no extent did I think that in going into this they would allow this kind of rubbish onscreen.So uninteresting it's actually frustrating, dialogues and scenes are insipid and empty, there's nothing at stake here. Characters are boring and as flat as the lighting in the VFX shots.Thé scènes last for ages, nothing happens, and then they end? Don't really understand how these kinds of projects are funded and produced :/ sry 2 all fans, but this is wildly empty.Honestly still writing at this point to get to the 600 character limit so this can get posted because i just need to express how absolutely uninspiring this is because aside from that there's literally nothing else to say."
"The stand out thing for me is the acting and the dialogue. GOT was also well done for most seasons. This reboot has an engaging story that hooks you almost instantly. The pace is extraordinary, as it keeps you engaged, is efficient with the plot, and isnt boring at all.I was not looking forward to 5ths series at all because of the ending of The Game of Thrones. The last season really disappointed and wore me out. By the end, I didn't like nearly any of the characters. .... I'm so glad that House of Dragons is exceeding in every way.I hope this reboot stays good all the way through. Keep these writers, they're doing a fantastic job."
"It's hard not to compare this to GoT, but this doesn't even come close. Even after watching it for 4 or 5 episodes you're wondering when one of the characters will at least catch your interest. It's not as horrendous as the final season of GoT thankfully , it is just painfully dull. There are no characters to either love or hate, they're all just forgettable. In GoT we all loved to hate joffrey and absolutely adored Tyrion. There's no character in House of Dragons that's likable at all, honestly I'm not even sure which character you're supposed to like. Matt Smith's character Daemon is supposed to be evil but , he really just becomes mildly annoying. All and all this show is just not worth the time it takes to watch it."
"Outside of the fact that the show is set in a world we already have a comfortability with, what can possibly be a positive?There isn't a single charismatic character in the show. From the jump of GoT you could tell Tyrian was interesting, Arya was a badass, The Hound was complicated, the Littlefinger/Varys interactions had great dialogue and you even wanted to trot for dumb Jon Snow.This show has no one to root for, the ""politics"" of the show are uninteresting and every character falls flat. I wouldn't want to have a conversation with a single on of them.I'm perplexed by the high ratings."
"I saw the episode early on and I have to admit it was a really good pilot everything was handled well the acting, the writing, music, dragoooooons, and now I have to wait 1 week for the second episode :("
"I just finished watching the first episode, it's OK but I do not feel the same way (impressed) as I was after watching the firs Got episode. For me it does not have the same feeling, it feels cheaper. Don't get me wrong, its not Xena but.....it misses something, maybe it will change, I hope it will."
"I stopped comparing it with Game of Thrones and I really began enjoying the show. GoT is an incomparable classic and House of the Dragon is a story from that universe. We should all stop comparing every character from the new show to the ones from GoT. In my opinion, if we should compare House of thr Dragon to something, probably we should compare the show to all modern shows, which are currently running. In that case, it looks great!Episode 9 was very well produced and directed. The story wasn't that complicated and was easy to follow and the ending was amazing. The acting and the effects are pretty good also! Give it a chance and watch it as a part of the universe, it can't be compared to GoT, it's just a different show with very very different characters. Of course, the atmosphere and the aura of the show are close to the original, but how can someone get into the story, if every time somrthing interesting happens, it's immediately compared to a scene or storyline from GoT? Watch it with an open mind, stop thinking about Jon Snow and Daenerys and it's actually very good tv."
"I'm writing this after having seen all 10 episodes of the first season, as I don't think it's right to rate something in its entirety without knowing its entirety. That being said, I'll start off by saying it was a slow start. While the first 4-5 episodes had their moments, I was, for the majority of the time, bored and uninterested. Let me tell you that it's a build up. A major build up. The first season spans over about 20 years. And the last half of the season was fantastic. I gave 8 out of 10 because I just loved the last half so much.No, House of the Dragon will never have the same impact that Game of Thrones did, but in HotD's defense, one of the reasons GoT was so incredibly popular was because it was the first of its time. The audacity of the writers to kill off main characters and the insane plot detail was shocking (in a good way) to viewers. And I don't think we'll ever reach that kind of state of shock again (since we're used to the risks these writers take).In many ways, I enjoy HotD more than GoT. The female characters absolutely rule this show, and I am 1000% here for it! I love the diversification of Westeros, the feminization of the characters, and the fact that the unnecessary sex scenes and nudity were done away with. I think most people appreciate when the sex and nudity have a purpose, rather than when it's only there to transfix the audience. (Btw, if you're one of the people who's bummed about the lack of these scenes, go watch porn or something!)"
House of The Dragon 🐉
"""Dreams didn't make us kings, Dargons did.""What a journey, as a huge fan of GRRM's world this was everything I could've ever hoped for and even more!The characters were perfect and every single actor has done their part perfectly. Young/Old Alicent and Rhaenyra were both astonoshing. Paddy Considine, who played King Viserys definitely deserves an Emmy award especially after his flawless acting in the last few episodes. ""The Queen Who Never Was"" Rhaenys Targaryen, I don't feel like she got the attention that she deserves but she was absolutely one of my favourite characters!I don't even need to talk about ""The Rogue Prince"" Daemon Targaryen, I guess we all know how amazing and spectacular this guy was. In episode three he hardly said a thing and barely spent around ten minutes, but still managed to steal the show!Cinematogrophy and CGI were everything you've come to expect with GOT but even bigger and better. It feels like everything was on a grander scale than before, this is truly the Targaryens in all their glory!Soundtracks, I mean I don't even need to talk about the score and soundtracks in this show, it's Ramin Djwadi.I also have to mention how surprised and amazed I was by the dialogues, they were absolutely stunning and well-written!The Dragons were much better than I expected, Vhagar was my favourite and is the largest and arguably most powerful dragon alive.""Then the storm broke, and the dragons danced.""Overall, I can say that this season was the best ""first season"" I've ever watched so far!Your thoughts about the show if you've watched it? And who's your favourite character?"
In comparison with GOT it is not interesting. But it is not that bad. It is somehow slow and sometimes boring
That stupid queen and her disgusting sons really get on my nerve. The queen that pretend that she is an honorable woman but actually she is a mean and vicious woman. Her older son that can't curb his lust and the seeking power and the throne . I don't like to see them alive. The hand is also another disgusting character hope to see him die sooni don't know for what reason the princess left the palace and let all the things in queens hands !!The scene that Rhaenyra's son fought with his uncle was really breathtaking . I wish the uncle be dead but the innocent kid died and it really wasn't the thing that i expected .Hope to see Rhaenyra punish the stupid queen and her sons.
"The storyline is boring. It's like Green as bad guys and Black as good guys very typical storyline.They made green characters boring and cutoff their important scenes and added unnecessary Black scenes to make them more likable. Dragon Sunfyre, which is an important dragon in the show has less screentime than unimportant dragons Meleys and Vermithor . Rhaenys blasting through dragon pit without any consequence is pure fan service.This makes the series less interesting and boring since Blacks characters have more interesting and good scenes and Green characters have pale scenes .There are no complex characters in the show. Daemon and to some extent Aemond are only characters that are complex."
"Wow.wow.wow. This was just what I needed, Game Of Thrones is back and is ready to set fire to the TV world. It has the dragons, the costumes and the Music - not to mention the phenomenal looking sets."
"Unlike Game of Thrones, which I was addicted to throughout its entire run because it had so many amazing characters to root for, House of the Dragon has almost no likable characters. Characters like Rhaenyra and Daemon I find only slightly less despicable than Alicent and her family. Also such a weird decision to change the actresses for Rhaenyra and Alicent during the time jump but keep the same actor for Daemon?! The only character who I truly liked was Rhaenys and I also liked the Velaryons. I just really miss having noble characters like Jon Snow, Brienne, and Arya. Or the mystical stuff like the Three Eyed Raven. I miss House Stark!On the plus side, the show looks amazing as expected from HBO. The costumes, elaborate sets, and use of The Volume make every episode look like a big budget movie.While I enjoyed the soundtrack, nothing really stood out to me the way certain tracks stood out from the original show. I wish they had done something more original for the opening credits song like play it in a different style than the original series.Anyway, I'll probably keep watching it but I'm much more interested in some of the other spinoff ideas that are floating out there like the confirmed Dunk and Egg series as well as the potential Jon Snow continuation series."
"The characters are one dimensional and there is no chemistry between any of them on screen. The special effects are laughable compared to what GOT was able to pull off even in it's first season. There is no sense of excitement or magic that game of thrones had. It is not immersive in the slightest, just boring conversation after boring conversation. Yes this is more political than game of thrones, but it is not a fun watch at all, which it very well could be. I've had to take breaks every 20 minutes to go do something else before I can finish an episode. Hopefully this gets better. I won't be recommending this to anybody."
"After seeing the first episode, all I can I say is WOW. This is all you could want from a dance of the dragons adaptation, it's breathtaking and the dialogue is great. Dragon look very realistic and when the dragon riders fly on their dragons, it is majestic. Music is spectacular, as always."
It feels just so so good to come back to Westeros again..! Even though the story is different Feels like i am back to Home..! I know HBO will not goof up again.
"All around great show so far, season one has utilized what early GOT has done but obviously at a better pace and with better visual effects by far. Perfectly sets up for season 2. All negative reviews are clearly from people without open minds stuck with unrealistic expectations; how are you judging season one of HOTD against a decade long of the most successful show of all time in GOT? Be practical. Logical. Great first season though. It was able to successfully dispose itself of the lacklustre GOT ending stigma IMO. If there was any room for potential improvement or change, I would say it's a bit unsettling how drastic the actor change was after episode 5, although it isn't cause anything lacking from Emma but rather cause the first Rhynarea did such a great & convincing job. I believe Emma has an adequate enough time to develop the character from here on out."
"I procrastinated for a bit before watching this series. I finally got around to it and binged it all weekend! I loved it! It was a little nostalgic to return to the world of GOT and all the houses fighting for the Iron Throne again. This one has a different story and it was actually very interesting especially how it highlighted so much of the role of women and how they are seen and treated in this world. I was totally captivated by all the characters and the acting was fantastic! I hope this has many seasons, because I'm hooked now and I want to see how this all plays out with the families!More, please! More!"
"Forget the other reviews on here if you're a fan of the books. Most people have no idea what they're talking about as they've not read the books and are comparing this to GoT the TV series (which in the end was horrific and left out huge plot lines from the book).This is not GoT, so don't expect it to be. It's a wonderfully shot drama with some incredible acting (Matt Smith is amazing). It's full of intrigue and stays truer to the book (yes, it's based on a book for all those expecting a reboot of GoT).It's far easier to follow the GoT was, as the story centres on one family rather than multiple families. Please don't go in to this expecting GoT as you'll only be disappointed. See it for what it is, sit back and enjoy."
"All I can say is, it was a masterpiece! They outdid themselves, everything was better compared to game of thrones pilot ( since it has a bigger budget ), hopefully it continues on!"
"This is like GOT's season 8, where the story runs on cliff notes moving from plot point to plot point. Yet at the same time, the story is thin and empty. By the time the story builds to the point where it gets interesting, the season ends. The rest are token power struggle cliches... some plotting, some counter plotting, some secret spy network of urchins/prostitutes, some murders, some marriages, some prophesying, and some dragons. Just peripheral fluff unattached to an actual story.Only a few characters are developed. The rest are clearly sacrificial lambs with no plot armor. Sadly, it's also very obvious which characters have plot armor and which don't, and the lack of character development makes deaths irrelevant to a story that hops from plot point to plot point.It's still a decent show, if only to offer just enough GoT-esque elements that trick the viewer into hoping for a repeat of early GoT greatness."
"I had my doubts about this not being as striking as GOT and it was slow in the beginning but man did they made up for it in the end!! The characters and their stories were handled so well. They managed to go deep with the characters with so many time leaps happening after every episode and still get the audience excited about the new ones. Alicent is the best example of character development, she went from a sweet girl to a mother who will do anything for her children even if it costs her her friendships. And in the end they gave us (me) all we wanted....a dragon fight!!! I mean that was the highlight of the series! The writers and the directors did what Game Of Thrones did best at it's best...manage so many characters and their individual stories well. I am really excited to see what happens next."
"The rating is for the first five episodes. I was hooked on GOT from the first two. Money and time spent on this one but the plot is boring, the main characters are not interesting and there is not a lot going on except who's marrying who. It desperately tries to create an intriguing atmosphere but fails so far. The actors seem that there are not into their characters yet although some are promising.GOT was a phenomenon and the legacy is a heavy burden. If not careful, it'll go down in flames.I really hope the characters will evolve and we are presented a solid story and not fragments from the princess diary."
"It's total bs to change source material and make House Velaryon all black just in the name of diversity. The book clearly describes what the Velaryans looked like. If you don't like the material find another book to create a show from. The quote that the creaters gave saying ""It was very important for Miguel and I to create a show that was not another bunch of white people on the screen"" is total garbage. Imagine if that statement was reversed and applied to a Tyler Perry show. This PC fake virtue culture is killing art these days. 20 yrs ago movies and TV shows had much more authentic substance."
The visual quality and Budget from the later seasons of
"the original series + the writing quality/ good casting of the first sesons. This sounds like a good combination and the executing from the showrunners deliverd. Even thoug I read the book on which this prequel is based I was on the edge on my seat every Episode on how it is going to turn out.It is not 10 Stars however beacuse you cant be perfect on every aspect, for example after the death of Deamonds original wife Leana Verlarion the Scene where he Shows is affections for at least his twin doughters got cut out of ther Version we saw and just got leaked on the Internet. It would have been nice to see this for his caracter and the ones of his kids.But that is just a small drop of water on an very hot stone of good writing/acting/special effects.( in perticular on the dragons)"
"As a big fan of game of thrones,what i can say that this is perfect prequel for game of thrones. It maintains It's good script,acting,bgm like game of thrones did. I am really happy to get a great series which reminds me of old game of thrones vibe. Acting was really good. Every actor did their best in the series. Acting of daemon targariyan was really good that i become a big fan of him. Also king veseris acting in episode 8 was totally mindblowing. One thing i noticed that there are not enough violence here in hotd like GOT but script and character was really amazing. Something big coming in season 2 i guess. Waiting for season 2 to see what happen next."
"The pilot sucks you right in and leaves you wanting for more. Definitely a heavier, grittier tone than Game of Thrones had and more closer to the world of ASOIAF created by George RR Martin. Each character is introduced in a natural way as opposed to the rather synthetic tone of the Thrones pilot. This show marks itself different and similar to Game of Thrones at the same time. HBO have struck gold once again and have themselves an amazing show!!"
"So far the show has been really interesting to watch, I have loved watching the first season and I've been waiting for the episodes to come out weekly. The characters have grown so much over the first 10 episodes and I look forward to the next season and more to come! I haven't read the book or know much about the lore of House of the Dragon but I am really enjoying what I'm watching. The actors have done a wonderful job at bringing these characters to life and seeing their development on screen has been lovely to watch, the story has kept me on the edge of my seat and I want to know what happens next!"
"I today's super quick, 10 second attention media, I struggled with the first few episodes. My brain wasn't used to having to concentrate and invest in a show. But eventually I realised it was my brain not the show!! And after investing in concentration the show opened up and was worth the effort. I've always thought Paddy Consindine was a good actor. But he's absolutely incredible in this series. Especially towards the latter part of the series, he's utterly, totally believable. I enjoyed watching his performance, sometimes you just know you're watching something special, an artist really in the zone, at their peak: Paddy was there for this show. He deserves an award for the way his character develops. Matt Smith was also excellent and all the cast was brilliantly cast. Really looking forward to the next series."
"Starts with narration rather than story, doesn't really grab ones attention at all at the beginning, starts slow. Pacing doesn't really grab you. Quite few likeable or even interesting characters. Like for most people, one or two characters.The music is pretty much immediately recycled from the onset, from GoT - and the notes feel unearned and overused in the context. Maybe a bit overdone at times with the violin etc.Mostly so far it's basically a family drama, with themes like 'queen/princess life is hard', 'brother bad', 'king grumpy' and incest I guess.Sex scenes are not exciting, very choreographed almost like a romance movie - and because of who's generally involved, almost always off putting in some way. There's no real wheeling and dealing. No intrigue.Hey, look, maybe they'll introduce some kind of real plot arc at some point and all the characters will stop feeling perpetually sorry for themselves. I'm entertained enough I'm still watching.I think with the narrow location, and the tighter existing cast, as well as some production/direction let downs, this will not reach the heights of GoT, but does, after the 2nd episode promise to be an entertaining show nonetheless. It's just okay. Currently significantly overrated because of nostalgia IMO. It's not the worst, it's not the best, but we'll all probably have forgotten what happened in five years time."
"I just had to write this review after watching the season 1 finale (episode 10). There are so few TV shows that are worthy of our time. This one is great. It lives up to Game of Thrones and since I havenÂ´t read the book itÂ´s all a surprise without it being butchered by other writers different to George R. R. Martin (who is a real master of his craft and I hope he finishes Game of Thrones at some point, better sooner than later, but here we are waiting). ItÂ´s gripping, itÂ´s fantasticaly acted. The actors and actresses are just terrific (in all their versions). CanÂ´t wait for season 2. Hope we donÂ´t have to wait until 2024."
"After ten episodes:The last three episodes have saved it. Since the major events happening at the court, everything is being put into a better, more dynamic scene. Names we know from the past are starting to come back to our years. The fight for justice is inevitable, the honor of the House Targaryen must be restored and I'm pretty sure Season 2 will be much better.Sure, it doesn't have the gory scenes and sexual scenes from GoT, but maybe there's a reason for it. Maybe it's meant to show that in the times before the reign of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister, the lands were not so decadent. But that's just a maybe from someone who didn't read the original books.After seven episodes:There is something missing. It just doesn't seem to have anything to say to me. Maybe it does to you, I don't know. But what defines these series for me is that... it's the only series from which I don't eagerly expect a new episode. All the series I'm watching right now make me wait for the new episode. This one doesn't. All I get is family drama and political meetings. Even those aren't good enough to raise the standards. It just... bores me.The only actors left that do make an impression now are Matt Smith and Paddy Considine. Fabien Frankel's role has faded, so did Rhys Ifans role. Matthew Needham is promising but gets little attention at the moment. Milly Alcock and Emily Carey were brilliant, now we are left with these actors who.. don't transmit anything. So far, I'm disappointed.From 6 stars to 5 stars. Waiting for something to happen. Anything!------------After four episodes:I am still waiting for something to happen. So far, nothing spectacular. Comparing House of the Dragon, the prequel to Game of Thrones, to The Rings of Power, the prequel to The Hobbit and the LOTR, this is weaker. Why am I comparing the two? Because they are both prequels to cinematographic masterpieces, from the writings of great writers, and they appeared in the same time. While The Rings of Power already presented a lot, House of the Dragon is still keeping a slow pace.Besides the dragons, there is nothing spectacular in this. It is a lot of politics, but little action. And by action I mean both fights and sex scenes. If we remember the way GoT started, we can easily see that this has a milder beginning. Not only that, but some scenes and dialogue were even cringe, which is not acceptable in a work based on the writings of George R. R. Martin. Even more, many scenes were so predictable! This is very different from GoT and really doesn't come close to the grandiose atmosphere that it had. I'm still waiting, but so far, nothing to catch the eye.From 7 stars it took it down to 6 stars.------------So far, the first two episodes were dull, and the second episode was very predictable.The actors, however, are very good. Paddy Considine, Rhys Ifans, Milly Alcock and especially Matt Smith are doing a great job. Actually Matt Smith seems a perfect fit.The visuals are very good, the story is decent so far.So for now, I'll give it a 7 star rating, and as the series go on, I will make changes to this review."
"House of the Dragon is the new big thing that most fans are praising as an instant masterpiece, and I think that's wildly overrating this show. While generally well written (mostly dialogue but not in other areas) and acted, I've seen WAY better shows than this in my lifetime. Maybe being a Game of Thrones prequel plays into it, plus the fact that Season 8 of that series is universally panned that people are eager to praise this new show, but I find it to be at best competent with a cast of interchangeably boring, forgettable, and unlikable characters. The entire series seems to be some kind of not-so-backhanded battle of the sexes with an emphasis on ""girl power."" HotD is centered around on the relationship between 2 female characters Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and her best friend growing up Alicent Hightower. Rhaenyra and Alicent started out being respectively played by Milly Alcock and Emily Carey as teenagers in the first 5 episodes of Season 1, then the roles were taken over by Emma D'Arcy and Olivia Cooke (from the masterful Bates Motel series) as adults in the last half of the season. Rhaenyra is the heir to her father King Viserys Targaryen (played by Paddy Considine from the comedy classic Hot Fuzz) and Alicent is the daughter of the King's right hand man Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans from The Amazing Spider-Man). The general plot of the first season are the repercussions of a female ruler taking over the kingdom once Viserys passes as that would be a first. Meanwhile, Otto schemes for power by pimping Alicent out to Viserys, which works since Viserys chooses Alicent as his new wife after his previous wife (and Rhaenyra's mother) died in the Pilot episode. With Alicent as the new Queen, this puts a strain on her friendship with Rhaenyra over the years, culminating in them growing apart and becoming enemies by the end of the season. The other players in this years long drama are (1) Prince Daemon (played by Matt Smith of Dr. Who fame), who is Viserys younger brother and the ruler of Dragonstone, (2) Princess Rhaenys (played by Eve Best from Fate the Winx Saga), who is Viserys' cousin that was passed over for the crown in favor of him, (3) Lord Corlys Velaryon aka The Sea Snake (played by Steve Toussaint), who is Rhaenys' husband and leader of the land's naval forces, (4) Ser Criston Cole (played by Fabian Frankel), a Knights Guard who starts out as Rhaenyra's protector and after falling out of favor with her, ends up as Alicent's protector.The acting on the show is fine, no major complaints, but none of these characters have any real depth or nuance. They just feel like trained actors spouting fancy sounding words with occasional sarcasm that makes viewers go nuts over. Young Rhaenyra was precocious and smarmy to the point of being a cliche modern sounding teenager and this show is set in a Medieval type world. Young Alicent just always looked confused and sad. One thing I think the show did well was aging up the 2 teens. Older Rhaenyra fared better than the younger one, but this seems to be an unpopular opinion. Older Alicent was also better for me than the young version because the older version had some actual energy and spirit. As for the rest, in particular, I found Rhaenyra's sons Luke and Jace to be very pesky and annoying. Alicent's kids Aegon and Aemond fared better as they some personality, but generally all of these kids came across as bratty modern teens. Cole was pretty underwhelming to me as well. Also, anytime Daemon says anything, I noticed that fans go nuts over his character as if he's the second coming of TV characters. Confusing why so many fans are obsessed with this character when he did much of nothing the entirety of Season 1 to the point he felt like a filler side character. Another confusing fan favorite to me is Rhaenys. Half of her ""dialogue"" is just constant smirking, which make fans lose their minds over for some reason, and the other half is just competent delivery of dialogue. Otto schemed and manipulated in the most obvious way possible. But there's just nothing underneath and this is how I feel about virtually every character. Again, the acting is good, but nothing groundbreaking or masterful. Viserys was probably the closest to any character on this show approaching award-worthy acting and that's mostly due to Considine's physical acting of a weary old man who was probably twice the actor's actual age and my guess is that he will most likely end up winning an Emmy in 2023 in whatever category that will give him the best chance to win. But in general, when the season was over, I felt NOTHING for any of these characters.Through most of the season, there were so many time jumps and inconsistencies. Viserys was always sick and dying of something and made long speeches about feeling like an unfit ruler and not being a warrior king. Then by next episode, which is always a time jump years later, he's alive and well and dying of something else. Young Rhaenyra was a full on feminist not wanting to marry a man but wanting to be Queen one day, yet Older Rhaenyra was all about motherhood and got away from her royal duties. Daemon just strutted around with an endless smirk and for some inexplicable reason struck fear into everyone he met even though he's pretty unintimidating physically. Alicent was constantly jealous of Rhaenyra's love life. Cole was just a tool and toy to be passed around by Rhaenyra and Alicent. The Velaryons were just throwaway side characters, basically waiting for the Targaryens to call on them to get involved in the plot. The Sea Snake has this big army of ships that were never seen, only heard about. He disappeared for the better part of a decade presumed dead and came back looking exactly the same, just with a cane. Sea Snake and Rhaenys' children Laenor and Laena existed just to be nominal spouses to Rhaenyra and Daemon who were callously tossed away after one episode to accommodate their eventual union late in the season. Daemon supposedly loves Rhaenyra, then chokes her in the finale with zero retribution from her. Supposedly, he does this because he's angry for being passed over by Viserys, yet he spent years at his own kingdom happy to be rich and lazy. And because of the big time jumps years later after each episode, it makes zero sense that characters are in the same place and frame of mind they were in the previous episode.The biggest plothole for me in the season was how the writers handled the ""death"" of Laenor. There's a distinct lack of emotion in this plot that is baffling and the way it is playing out makes zero sense to me. I don't understand how Laenor, Rhaenyra, and Daemon would to the trouble of staging Laenor's death, yet at the very least not telling his parents about it. Wouldn't they be happy to know that their son is alive and well and living the life that he wants to with his lover? How could Laenor put his parents through this unnecessary grief given that they just lost his sister. Why are Rhaenys and Corlys so blase about it? Also, Daemon killed his brother as well. If Sea Snake and Rhaenys are secretly scheming and playing Daemon and Rhaenyra as they support their claim to the kingdom, then the latter duo aren't very smart for concealing Laenor's true fate. And if they aren't playing them, then that means they really don't care about their son at all. Rhaenys could have easily just said she supports Alicent in that crowning Aegon episode and demanded that her granddaughters be brought to her safely. Speaking of, that was the worst episode of the season with that ridiculous ending of Rhaenys unnecessarily killing hundreds of innocent citizens to have a ""girl power"" moment. The show has an undercurrent of agenda-riddled storytelling that I suspect will become more and more obvious as the series wears on in future seasons. And the finale was probably in the bottom 3 episodes of the season finishing it out on a whimper.Another problem with this show is the inconsistent way it aged the characters. Viserys aged a lot over the season and of course Alicent and Rhaenyra aged due to older actresses, but characters like Otto, Cole, Rhaenys, Daemon, and Corlys just stayed looking the same in the same time span that Viserys seemed to age 25 years! And I even think they stopped aging Alicent and Rhaenyra once they had kids. People can change a lot even over a 5-year time span and 10 years later characters don't change at all. It's like the makeup department didn't care about such things, which would have added to the authenticity and continuity. The show has hired competent actors playing soulless characters playing dress up and wearing really bad wigs, saying fancy words, roaming around sweeping locations with some really good CGI (for a change). But yet there's no heart, no depth, no nuance. Everything is plain and obvious. No characters really leap off the screen with personality. The dialogue is too on the nose in most scenes and not nearly as clever as the writers think it is. The atmosphere is heavy on misogyny and feminism to the point I can always tell when the writers want the viewer to clap and cheer for progress. And based on the incredibly positive reactions to this series (I'm seeing YouTube videos of people literally clapping and cheering), their obvious storytelling is working. While the cinematography, costumes, and effects are good, the dialogue is extremely shallow despite the generally competent acting. But masterpiece? Not even close. Style over substance."
"King Viserys who played...Paddy should get Amy reward!!Omg...he was amazing, and his acting touches my heart, his loneliness, helplessness, gown age and pain, suffering before death broken my heart. His unconditional support for his daughter, levels of acting, the sigh of the end of his life, made me cry. HBO should send list to Amy reward, I will 100% support him and whole team. Paddy is the best acter in this year. Thank for the team choose Paddy , we can see the best show this year. And others actors too, I enjoyed House of dragon, well done HBO.By the way...the review needs 700 words...too much! My English isn't so good, too hard to me.(ha)"
"Season One: 8.5/10Themes: High-Fantasy, Drama, Adventure, Royalty, Dragons, Marriage, Action, Betrayal, Family, Politics, Pregnancy, War, Feminism & Succession to the Throne.Review: The setting of this series is, as expected, stunning and reminiscent of Game of Thrones, which is one of this show's major selling points. However, despite its awesome premise and lovely visuals, I have to admit that I had some issues with some of the execution. We skip in time A LOT and it's quite jarring. A lot of the events that happen also do not appear to make any sense and aren't explained whatsoever. We miss certain key details, which is a shame. Lastly, the plot wasn't the best either. Not a lot happens and the whole thing mostly just feels like a build-up for the next season. Nonetheless, this review has definitely sounded very negative so far, and that's not fair either. This series really does show a lot of promise. It surely manages to capture my engagement and investment.Top five characters: 1) Rhaenyra Targaryen, 2) Daemon Targaryen, 3) Viserys I Targaryen, 4) Rhaenys Targaryen and 5) Alicent Hightower.Least favourite character: Ser Christon Cole."
"It's an amazing adaptation of the book, the actors do a such a good job of portraying their characters, Olivia Cooke (Older Alicent) and Matt Smith (Daemon) are definitely my favourites, they embody their characters so well. The casting is so well done and although we only get a short time with certain characters before they get killed off it's still impactful. The cinematography is so good and it was a refreshing change from game of thrones, I can't explain it but the two have a very different feel to them. If you enjoyed the kings landing plot in game of thrones you will definitely love this show."
"Thank God they got the original Theme Song of GOT back !!!As For the Show ..... SPECTACULAR!The Narration helps you get clarity and also for those few who did not watch GOT , it just gets easy to relate.The actors are Super Fine and in every way Match the grandeur of GOT.For all Dragon Lovers.....they just get bigger and better , seeing them in skies makes your heart a flutter.Matt smith is my favourite ...he carries This magnetism like no other and you cannot gauge his character. He deserves an OvationEverything is different but the intensity is same.can't wait to see what more is there in the offing."
"I've only watched the first two episodes, but so far this series is very much the old school GoT we all enjoyed. We've got a strong group of main characters, an interesting backstory, and a classic downfall storyline to follow. Matt Smith is perfectly cast, and the look, sound and feel is just what we hoped for. Do bear in mind that this is a violent show, much the same as the original series. Plus, as an added bonus we get dialogue that is written and spoken by adults.Fingers crossed it avoids the fate of the last seasons of GoT. I will return and adjust this review as the series progresses."
"Had mixed feelings going into this show. I had low expectations, and while some of the storyline was a little repetitive of GOT, the overall season was very good. Great cliffhanger ending, great character development, much less sex and a little more attention paid to storylines. The cinematography was beautiful as always.This of course still does NOT forgive the last season of GOT, but it was good TV. I don't think anything will fix the last season except for a new post GOT show that somehow rectifies the sloppy, lazy, unrefined, train wreck that was season 8. However I've been surprised before by this franchise so I'm not ruling out what could happen in following seasons of HOD's."
"I originally deplored this prequel to GOT because it seemed to be merely a scheme to cash in on the popularity of that masterful series. After further reflection, I find it a worthwhile backstory to the original.It's interesting to get a perspective on the Targerian dynasty and the story of how the ""mad king"" Aegon took power and caused the fracturing of the seven kingdoms that preceded the story of the Stark family.Paddy Considine and Matt Smith are good as the antagonistic but loyal brothers of the Targerian family. Olivia Cooke and Ewen Mitchell are also good as the queen and Aemond Targerian."
"This show essentially captured the cinematic storytelling that Game of Thrones was able to create. The acting is pretty good and the characters by the end of the season are decently established alongside the storyline. It still earns the HBO mark and incorporated some of the adult themes and elements from GOT (nudity, gore, incest etc.) that brings the shock and taboo. There's still the web of lies, corruption, discussions, and moving bits among all of the people each vying for something or for the throne as before. Plenty of drama and a good amount of action to go along with everything else. There were some issues with the season from the excessive amounts of focus on miscarriages that were sometimes really graphic and almost unnecessary to get the point across. Additionally, the beginning dragged as it struggled to establish the storyline the characters and so on only for mid-way through to change them up after finally getting the audience connected to them. It was almost like searching for its own identity within the GOT world/lore while trying to stay true to the expectations everyone would have. I think by the end that was accomplished enough for season two to be primed for a really good season. There were also certian characters that were surprisingly good like King Viserys who ended up with a great key role in the storyline that acted very differently than most characters of GOT or even House Of Dragon that was almost a little relieving because of how human he was. A nice touch I thought of distinction and a new layer to add among the common GOT world tropes.Overall the season dragged a little in the very beginning and struggled again mid-way through with the age jump but despite this created an entertaining storyline worthy of a GOT prequel/follow up that ends having prepared season two for what I would predict to be far greater now that this show has seemed to really find itself. I look forward to Season Two where I hope my predictions are right and this show really just soars."
"It's really just stupid, in a lot of ways. Give it a watch and decide for yourself. But if you thought the last episode of GOT was bad, hang on to your shorts. We already know how it's going to end. So unless there is something special that happens that could change the outcome of GOT its inherently predictable. Maybe they'll expose that someone is of a different bloodline than we thought and establishes a new claim to the thrown that inspires a sequel to GOT. But I doubt it. That would be interesting and so far this show isn't interested in being interesting. Also, none of the characters are likable."
"I was really hooked by the show and really attached to the characters from the first episode. Story was slowly building up with the characters and let us to enter into their world. Till episode 5 it was good because of the actress who played princess and queen. A slow growth of clash building up and made us to feel their rage and made us to wait for what's next. Episode 5 literally did that impact of Wow.And then Episode 6 staterd, just like that the excitement of the series broken like that. Changing the best chaterters was definitely not a good move at all. The attachment with the characters just disappeared like that. Deamon and the princess had a excellent wave between then.But now the excitement for the series has lowered drastically. A very very very bad decision to change the lead characters. Disappointed hugely."
"We're living in a world where squeals & prequels are extremely difficult to write and produce. If given that opportunity it's because the original set a very high bar and expectation people have come to expect, therefore making a follow-up series has to be far more intimidating to make than its predecessor.From the captivating acting and storytelling to the stunning production value, this hit HBO series is sure to be an award-winning adaptation from George R. R. Martin and has gained an enormous following of dedicated fans.I'm very interested to see where and what direction this series takes us and it seems the series is in very good hands."
I was very excited for this and it did not disappointed me 1st ep was lit. It has almost the got vibe you would notice when you see same set designs more voilence more brutality and more interesting story
Overall better than got till now.
"I wasn't surprised it was amazing. At all. It already showed promise wit the trailers and promos and IT DELIVERED. The CGI, acting, dialogue, pacing, are all perfectly executed. Didn't think that Aemma Arryn could pull my heartstrings like that when she was only mentioned in one paragraph in the book. Such a standout. Matt Smith, who I'll probably call Matt Daemon for months to come lol, was amazing. Viserys' character is what I expected, a weak king but a good father. So far I'm loving it, if they keep at it for sure HBO will have another GoT in their hands. I wish I could rate it more than than 10."
"After the last season of ""Game of Thrones"", I had no enthusiasm for this series. I have never read the book. After watching the first episode, I realized that I missed it. As always, the acting was excellent. Although the time jumps are a bit quick, I really liked it. Production, camera work, script and stuff were good. Effects were also better. They did a great job compared to the first season. Maybe it still hasn't been a very famous series like ""Game of Thrones"", maybe it is, but I don't know, but at least it's a very, very good series like ""Game of Thrones"". I am looking forward to the next seasons. Congratulations to the team, they still did a great job. I hope it doesn't end like ""Game of Thrones"". Congratulations !"
"Initially I really thought this show would be bad, but damn this was great."
"I can definitely understand the 9/10 ratings at the moment but I will say for me this wasSolid, nothing too crazy but hey,"
"8/10 is good.It's the first episode. My rating can go higher depending on how this season and of course if they actually end it good...I admit... GoT still left a real bad taste in my mouth.I won't hold this show accountable though.The story, execution and pacing was nice. I like the thrills and surprises as well, I don't understand some minor bad reviews saying this is ""woke"" I don't understand it's not woke at all... they must not have watched she-hulk recently lol this show is far from that.It has a very nice narrative. Some characters I would say might need to grow more in future episodes. There isn't a character I latched onto just yet. Idk what it is. But hey, it did a great job at executing what this episode was trying to map out for the show as a whole. It did so thrillingly as well..."
Well I'm still waiting for this show to pick up but so far it's really boring and the characters pretty bland. The actors are no where near as good as in the original show.I hope it picks up as I like the universe.The music is great and the technical aspect is also pretty great.The story so far fails to engage me in anyway and I don't really root for any of the characters as I did on the original show.I will keep watching as I hope it will pick up in either this season or the next.Matt Smith who plays Daymon Targaryen is the most solid actor so far on the show but comparing it with the original show it still falls short IMO.We'll see where the show goes...
"The first episode of GOT had whitewalkers, incest, beheading etc. This episode just had Daemon who doesn't have any nuance in his character just a straight up bad guy. I am Not sure about Paddy Considines reason for getting rid of Matt Smith, because he said something nasty and hurt the Kings feelings? I hope we are not moving into the plot driven way of writing of the last 2 seasons of GOT."
"After going through it all, i feel a bit betrayed - but it does have the westeros feel.Is is worthy of GOT original books ? No. Is it worthy of Dance of the dragons ? Not sure so far... ofcourse its hbo and big budget so it's better than your average show... but it is missing the essentials parts.Basically this show has 1 plot , 1 stake ... pretty much 1 set , and very few characters and somehow it is 10 episodes and so expensive to make ? What a disappointment..Let be honnest, it felt like watching bits of game of thrones put together back again but missing the best parts.. I wont spoil but even some of the best scenes were a bit ""too"" exaggerated , too quick or just lack the ""jenesaisquoi"" wich ICE and Fire had...Daemon could have been nice twist but fall flat , the whole story revolves about the same thing over and over with basically no character that you really care for ..."
"I wanted to like a few of them but honestly you dont really care ! There is no one to really root for not really any « wow » twist.Lets go back to episode 1 of game of thrones... you have white walkers menace , you have dany sold, you have jon leaving, a family to root, ned to follow, conspiracies to unfold, Lanisters doing their things and pushing a kid off a tower. I mean you have things going on !!! For @& sake...Here 10 episodes of much the same at different times.The story never really expand : Not so many characters , plot or world to show forbut still we are happy to watch all this ! Dragons are awesome :)Some Good thing so far are : the King who is weak but strong enough to make him more complex and relevant. As well as Daemon story wich seems to carry most of the early season.So far main 3 actors doing great.It has More budget than first season of GOT But maybe less impressive to some other show that i wont mention here.Anyhow : Westeros is awesome and we can only be happy to have more stuff to watch :)Approved so far."
"After five episodes I am underwhelmed. Trying to be patient since I know it takes time to build the story and introduce characters but thus far I feel nothing. There is not one interesting character and when an episode ends I don't feel excited to see the next one. The only characters I remotely like are Rhaenyra and Alison Hightower who seem more interesting than they really are because the other characters are so dull. The two young actresses who play these women are about the only thing in the show I would give praise to and they will be disappearing in episode 6. As a villian, Dameon is a minor leaguer compared to characters like Joffrey, Ramsey Bolton and the Mountain. Next week we have another time jump and perhaps things will improve but I won't hold my breath. The only way to get this show going is to kill off King Viserys and get a war of succession started."
"This show is drastically different from game of thrones, this is a more personal confined story, its a civil war. The book, ""Fire & Blood"" is a history book, very different from A song of ice and fire, the books game of thrones is based on, ""Fire & Blood"" contain almost no information on the dialogue, and the events are spread with no information on what happened between them, mostly since nothing of note happened, thus the time jumps are necessarily, unless you want to watch a slice of life, which well be more boring. Stop comparing this show to game of thrones, it has the same flavor but nothing more so know what to expect as not to be disappointed. I believe that after episode six things will become more intriguing, the plot will thicken..."
"It took a bit getting used to, but thoroughly enjoyed this season of house of the dragon. Although the original GoT put a sour taste in everyone's mouth, this brings it back to dragons and drama, with shocking twists and turns which is very amusing.Highlights off the top of my head is Matt Smith, who is clearly loving being in the role, and the King as well (who cannot catch a break with all the drama going on around him). These two characters pull the show for me, along with the dragons of course.My favorite scene might be the scene after all the children fight and everything is super tense in the dining hall. You never really know what will happen in Westeros...and this show is no exeception.Hoping that it continues strong, as it's quite enjoyable and will continue to be so as the characters are now well established after the first season."
"Ok i have to say it is good! But why so many violence, so much blood bath? Whats the reason? Maybe some people cannot see this seems real scenes maybe are disgusted with so many blood! As GOT of course! U can pass all this or just dont show so many violence!The birth scene of 1st episode was reslly brutal , with no reason! Just wait to see other episodes!GOT was good enough but with awful ending, hope this not the same."
"Like many viewers, I was skeptical about watching this prequel to ""Game of Thrones"", simply because I felt it would have been hard to top the intensity of the earlier series. I needn't have worried; the writers came up with a compelling story line with an intriguing cast of characters that managed to meet high expectations with each episode. Granted, there's a somewhat confusing time jump with the start of the sixth episode that takes place ten years after the conclusion of the fifth, marked by different actors replacing key characters, so that takes a little getting used to. But throughout, the program maintains the high level of regal duplicity, debauchery, and violence that characterized its predecessor. It's hard to imagine now how ""Game of Thrones"" maintained its must-see status over eight seasons, and one can only hope that the finale of episode ten here leads to an even more exciting second season for ""House of the Dragon"". If the look in the eye of Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) can be taken as any indication as the story closes, there seems little room for doubt."
"Having read the books and knowing how very little dialogues contained in the Fire & Blood, I'm surprised by how well the Dialogues are written. It's like George himself is the writer of the first episode, Ryan Condal did an amazing and superb job, as did Miguel Sapochnik. I need no more convincing, it's already a million miles better than the last 4 seasons of Game of Thrones. It's the most faithful adaptation of a A Song of Ice and Fire novel, yet. I can safely say, Game of Thrones is back. Can't wait for the remainder of the season!"
"Must watch it. It contains same thrills as GOT has. Everything is fine . Costume, dialogue, cgi,acting, cinematography, storyline etc.. are great. It doesn't disappoint you."
"It is, I believe one of the best series I've seen this year!!! So well written, the first few scenes kinda jump around quickly, but the connections and the decisions are soooo well done!!!The dialogues are so well written, that everyone are taken back to the GoT era!!!The throne and the realm are shown beautifully!!!!"
"Was really looking forward to this but very disappointed with the first episode. Trying too hard to get in as many GOT call backs as possible. Here's some gore. Here's an orgy. Dracarys! Ooh a Baratheon and a Tarly. No meaning to any of it. The dialogue is awful and the speech unnatural. No weight to the characters compared to the GOT opener which was intriguing and shocking. This felt formulaic.""I'll have a male heir"". He won't.""I won't be made to choose"". He was.""We can't have a female heir"". They do."
"I can't wait for the second episode :) I got to watch the episode early on, I have ready Fire and Blood and am pretty happy with what I have got !!!!!!!!!"
"The series literally starts from the half way point of Fire and Blood. The first scene states it's 101AC. Soooo much of the story has been dropped and we start at a point that misses so many fantastic arch's. I wanted to see land turn into a city. Even the kings road being built. I won't say the major storylines from the book in case you want to read ( which I recommend) but believe me, this already feels like the story will be made up soon. At least GOT started from the very beginning. But as a first episode, it was gory and led on a good impression from the book. Some good acting too. Matt Smith does a good job in the first episode and I already dislike him which is the point. Obviously there hasn't been much to go on in one episode but it's promising. I'd give it an 8-9 but I can't stop thinking about how much has been missed."
"Violence and gore are in service only to themselves here. It seems that ""shock"" value is what sells the show to new generations. Violence is rather unnecessary and doesn't really help the plot or character development. It's there because someone said it needs to be there. Everything needs to be ""graphic"" nowadays. There is no art in this show. There is no class in it. There is no worthy plot or anything except it's ""shock"" value. Empty minutes filled with blood. One second of Jackson's LOTR has more class to it than this full boring show. Can't say I expected too much, but some things are better left dead in the graveyard. I just hope that Martin will do the justice to book series as it would be a huge shame that this work represents his work in novels."
"One mis-step from the writers really affected my overall enjoyment of the show, and therefore my score. Breaking through on Dragonback and heedlessly, and counter-productively killing hundreds, or thousands of smallfolk during Aegon's coronation was not the right decision in my mind. It didn't seem in keeping with Rhaenys's character. Why would she think this is a good decision? I also thought the CGI previous to that, showing the upper reaches of the chamber looked a bit cheap.But my main issue is that after putting herself in that position, and not torching the rivals to the throne, her character is damaged.We could've heard Meleys roar, and then as Aegon was thrusting his sword over his head, we could've seen the dragon rising through the sky in the background.We could've seen Rhaenys fighting her way out of the dragon pit.But smashing through the floorboards not only looked terrible but was a decision that seems made for the viewer, for spectacle, and therefore it breaks the illusion that what we're watching is organic, and occurring because of previous events and actions."
"I was hesitant in watching this adaption of a prequel story written by George R. R. Martin due to the way things ended on 'Game of Thrones', a show which I still dearly love but left me unsatisfied with its ending. When I started with the first episode of 'House of The Dragon' a while back, I was immedietly sold and ready for the wild ride that would await me.The way the story is told is brilliant. As one would expect, large and frequent time skips are bound to annoy some folk. Not me, though. I find it intriguing and very fitting to this type of story: almost like a history book. This whole idea of all these different characters gradually dividing in two camps, Greens and Blacks- slowly building a grudge for one another which will undoubtedly lead to a war for the Seven Kingdoms is nerve wrecking to watch in a good way. I'm constantly on the edge of my seat!All of the actors brought their A-game to the screen, both experienced and lesser experienced. Character personalities didn't die with the change of certain actors thru time but grew. One of the standouts is of course Matt Smith's Daemon Targaryen- and I was very pleasantly surprised by Milly Alcock's portrayal of the younger Rhaenyra Targaryen and will watch her career unfold with great interest A nod to Paddy Considine's Viserys as well, he truly embraced the character and made it his own. I hope he wins plenty of awards for his groundbreaking performance.Ramin Djawadi crushed it once more, as expected. His music brought a lot of emotion to 'GoT' and now it does so again in 'HotD' by bringing new scores and adding hints and nods from previous score to some tracks to give us a heartfelt feeling of nostalgia. The sound design is also pristine!The show is beautifully filmed as well, both day and night. One episode was a bit hard to watch because I believe it was filmed day for night in a way that wasn't perfect, but other than that all was good. The visual effects on the dragons is absolutely incredible which is just perfect since after all there are a ton of dragons present during this period of time in the show.Can't wait for the next season! I hope the writers don't drop the ball and keep amazing us with their so far almost spotless adaption of this story. A solid 9/10 for me."
"House of the Dragon predates the Game by 200 years.The Seven Kingdoms are under the rule of house Targeryan.This prequel is a little more soap opera than Game of thrones.But I found this series to be rock solid and having George RR Martin in the background keeping a steady hand on his his creation to be a plus.Matt Smith who I hated as the doctor, hit a home run with me as Damon Targeryan.I am looking forward to season Two, when I will finally see the Stark's again.Criticism aside from other reviewers, this series in my opinion is a home run compared to some of the Junk( Kurtzman Trek), as one example of garbage being forced on us ,whether we like it or not.Unlike other networks, HBO is still turning out quality programs."
"Overall - average 5!Ep.1-3 - OK we need some time.Ep. 4-6 - well, not that bad, finally something catchy.Ep. 6-8 - wtf? We jump some years ahead, again and again. Plot shifts, some actors change (I mean with another older actor), other (same actor) looks absolutely the same..."
"Disappointing!Well by some reason I have to add 300 more letters to reach 600, very 'clever'!So.I haven't watch the original series, despite my wife's huge fan.I was hoping this prequel (ot sequel) or whatever will catch me.Well... no thanks!And 64 more characters needed!Dear IMDB can't I have opinion in 300? Or in 100? Or in 14 for example - stupid website!"
"In that scene where Rhaenyra's baby is dead, If this scene was written like that !I was waiting for her(Rhaenyra) to go to her dragons like Daemon's wife, but instead of dying because she is a pure Targaryen against fire, her baby is born with the heat of dragon fire.Like the scene in Game of Thrones, Deanerys didn't burn in the fire. Because Princess Rhaenyra was born of Targaryen parents, she should have been fireproof. And that they didn't even mention that the Targaryens were fireproof.."
"There should be a powerful son or girl born into the Targaryen family, either similar to the sequence I saw or otherwise, who were Deanerys parents in Game of Thrones."
"Ok, so we're only two episodes in and 5 stars might be being harsh - time will tell - but so far I'm staggered by the juxtaposition between what I've watched and the rave reviews I've read.Recently I rewatched the first GoT season and even on its meagre budget the look and feel of it is more authentic, more visceral, the characters more engaging, the story more nuanced and the episodes better directed.This, however, feels like GoT lite with little to no intrigue and reams of scripted exposition.I understand why the dialogue in this prequel is intentionally more antiquated than in the original show, but that's no excuse for the stilted, awkward delivery in some scenes; Especially guilty here is the actor portraying Lord Corlys, who's more wooden than a table - I'm not blaming the actor, I'm blaming the script.We also have the strange CGI backgrounds which seem to have been willfully instructed to depict King's Landing and Dragonstone as watercolour paintings, I've seen more convincing artwork on SyFy.Rhaenyra who is presumably the protagonist is actively dislikeable, the plot is thinner than straw and it just doesn't feel like the complex, expansive, massive and in depth Westeros that we have come to know and yearn for.So, redeeming features? Matt Smith, despite it taking a while to get used to his blonde wig, is actually exceptionally good as the rougeish, probably psychotic but charming Daemon Targaryen. There's also Olivia Cooke who is outstanding as the empathetic and hauntingly resigned Alicent Hightower. I'll also give a nod to Paddy Considine who plays King Viserys with a tenderness that's palpable but feels somehow out of place given the broader arc of that character.I know that I'm going to watch the series through to the bitter end because I hope to see it become more than the one dimensional struggle to become ruler than it's currently set up as.I really hope to revisit and update/upscore this review if it improves."
"The show does look gorgeous but, at least in the 2 firstepisodes, it feels like it has major pacing issues.Peopl;e are saying it is as fgood as GoT, maybe they should rewatch GoT first episode and seee how strong of a start it is in comparison, presenting a ton of new characters without needing so much exposition.House of the Dragon feels slow, full of painfuylly slow exchanges between characters for exposition alone, show don't tell is the rule I feel was forgotten here.Hoping it is a slow burn and it will pick up sooner rather than later but so far, not impressed and as good as Game of Thriones it is not."
"This series is incredibly rich, very well written with powerful dialogues and a 90% perfect pacing.The entire cast is brilliant and Matt Smith is pure perfection. He carries the show even when he has no dialogue!!Loved every minute of it, and we are only at E.3. The House of the Dragon is definitely a must see and those dragons... oh goodness, they are majestic!As each and every adaptation, some things have been changed from the original events but the power of the story remains the same which is not always so easy, especially considering the different narrations and the target to which this series speaks/aims to.Indulge yourself in Westeros, bring your favourite treats/junk food/fruits whatever, sit back, relax and enjoy this show."
So far so boring. It's no Game of Thrones that's for sure. None of the characters are likeable or particularly interesting. And it's got Netflix stench of wokeism. Let's hope it improves.
"I never imagined this show will go so down. It's a melange between vampires saga, death walking saga and tik-tok. The writing is awful and is oriented to young adults, which is not my play. Everything till now is just a house drama with medieval costumes and lack of understanding. It looks like they have those great props and need some more money to pay for them. It seems there is no plot, no real objective and no understanding. If you were to prequel a successful series such as Game of Thrones you should have asked yourself what can i bring forward? In this case nothing. But maybe is me looking for higher standards."
"If a television show had a pulse, someone could strap a blood pressure cuff on this one and promptly declare it dead. Dead on arrival, even, because as far as I'm concerned, House of the Dragon never showed any signs of life at all.Horrid writing, mediocre (at best) acting, dull and insufferable dialogue and an incoherent story line that just meanders, stalls and then time jumps in hopes of resuscitating the floundering plot. What the hell is this show even about, other than some mild dispute over the next in line to the throne? Yawn. I mean, haven't we seen that story a few thousand times by now, and by shows that do it much better than this one?I generally like to watch a full season before I write a review of a show, but with this one, I couldn't make it past episode six. And believe me: getting that far was a struggle. After the princess' main guard was allowed to run amok at a wedding feast, beating a guy to death while the princess herself goes unprotected, I had to tap out. I mean, this is a guy who already screwed the princess without consequence and now he can just randomly trash the king's big event without so much as a newspaper to the nose?If the character of Ser Criston Cole wasn't so damn boring, poorly acted and unbelievable, I might care about some of this. If the king himself, that feckless wonder, didn't look more like a guy heading off to his bowling league than the highest royalty in a family of dragon riders, I might wonder why he didn't get his house in order. This clown gets bullied by everyone, including his malignant daughter. These are the fearsome Targaryens?Truly, one of the worst big budget shows I've ever seen. The writers are completely unable to recapture any of the sleazy glory of Game of Thrones. They don't seem to have any interest or ability to make the Targaryens as frightening and exciting as they are in the worlds buily by George Martin, either. If anything, this putrid series comes off as a 1970s soap opera; a really, really bad soap filled with the limpest characters I've ever seen anywhere.Somehow, in spite of a pile of terrible reviews, this show manages to maintain a rating in the high 8s on IMDB. That's pretty impressive for a lifeless train wreck of a show that came to us with a toe tag already in place. You will pardon the mixed metaphors; I'm enraged at having been tricked into watching so much of this crap."
"Coming back to this franchise after everything that happened with the later seasons of GOT was certainly an experience. I would have been happy to be mad at how bad this ist - but its just not. The pacing is obviously awful. But this will change by season 2. So this is a set up season - which was clearly comunicated upfront.The acting is phenomenal, the visuals are great (expect for one episode where we went dark again), the soundtrack doesn't miss and the topics at hand are more relevant than ever. The only real complaint is that it relies a little too heavy on explaining the characters and plotpoints after the episode. Leaving some things up for interpretation is fine but sometimes you are alowed to make it clear. Again - could just be because this is a first season that rushes through so much."
"Game of Thrones has cemented its position as a monumental and ground-breaking achievement in the history of television and has set a massive bar for House of the Dragon to live up to. However due to excellent writing, impeccable performances and spectacular production values across all the departments, the first season of House of the Dragon delivers a very promising setup to a story that could very well live up to the quality and pop-culture significance of its predecessor.Set nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon follows the Targeryen family at the height of their power. Underneath the flashy action/battle scenes, the gore and the breathtaking dragon sequences, the show is at it's core, an emotionally powerful and deep character-driven drama as well as an engaging political thriller. The show is filled to the brim with exceptional performances, the most noteworthy being Paddy Considine as King Viserys. Rather than being depicted as a stereotypically strong, powerful and noble king, Viserys was portrayed as a grieving widower trying his very best to connect with his daughter and struggling to keep his family from tearing itself apart due to the brewing internal conflicts, all the while suffering from a fatal illness that is slowly and painfully killing him. Paddy Considine delivered a magnificent portrayal of the character making him humanized and relatable, which has got the masses screaming for an Emmy nomination/win for the actor, and deservedly so. The most noteworthy part of his performance comes in the sequences in Episode 8 where we see the extreme pain and suffering induced by the illness and Considine delivered an incredibly accurate and sympathetic portrayal of a man suffering from excruciating pain and agony, approaching his painful final moments. The throne room sequence and the dinner table speech were moments deserving particular praise for the actor.Yet another standout performance was delivered by Matt Smith as Daemon Targaryen. Despite being an unhinged murderous psychopath, Daemon has quickly become an icon and a fan-favorite, thanks to Smith's charismatic portrayal and the nuanced writing of the character. Smith also did an excellent job in conveying the unpredictable nature of Daemon. The breakout star of the show was Milly Alcock who showcased an exceptional performance as Rhaneyra Targaryen, who definitely has a very promising career ahead of her. Emma D'arcy also delivered an equally impressive performance as the older version of the character. The supporting cast also did an magnificent job, particularly Ewan Mitchell as Aemond Targaryen.One of the most noteworthy aspects of the show is its heart and emotional impact. The sequences depicting Viserys' miserable health conditions were among the most emotionally powerful moments in the entire Game of Thrones universe. The show consists of complex and deep characters and also focuses on the equally complex relationships between them. The season did an outstanding job in making us invested in the characters and their respective storylines and arcs as well as their roles in the overall story.The cinematography of the show is nothing short of marvelous. Just like its predecessor, the show is filled with gorgeous, impeccably blocked and composed shots. The production design and costume design are among some of the very best ever committed to television. The visual effects totally lives upto the revolutionary achievements of its predecessor. The CGI work done on the dragons are particularly noteworthy. Not only were the dragons created with incredible designs and immaculate details but the VFX team also did a commendable job in the conveying the size and scale of the massive creatures, with respect to the live-action counterparts. The action/battle sequences also deserve a big round of applause as they were all wonderfully directed, choreographed and filmed. The Battle of the Stepstones from Episode 3 and the climactic Dragon duel from Episode 10 were sequences deserving particular mention. Ramin Djawadi delivers yet another beautifully composed soundtrack to the world of Westeros. All these aspects together make this show an enthralling cinematic experience.Despite a few minor pacing issues regarding a couple of jarring time jumps in a few instances, the first season of House of the Dragon is a spectacular achievement in all aspects of filmmaking. It perfectly sets up the story, world, characters and conflicts and laid the overall the foundation for the future of a show that has a solid potential to be as big of a pop-culture juggernaut as Game of Thrones."
Production - 10/10
Storyline - 10/10
"Cinematography - 10/10Am loving it already, can't wait for the completion of the Season ðŸ˜€. Multi - kingdom stories and power shift soon to start."
"We're two epsiodes deep into House of the Dragon so far and people are rating it as though they've watched the entire thing. It's absolutely disingenuous to critique an entire season of a TV show based on two episodes unless that season is two episodes long which this clearly isn't). Do people not realise you can review each episode? (Hang on, I know you can rate each episode but can you review each episode? I best check before I continue, eh? ANSWER: YES YOU CAN, PEOPLE! HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW THAT? Noobs!)Anyway, the first two episodes are perfectly fine and mostly in keeping with the story ""The Rogue Prince"". The thing about TV shows is over the course of a season they build momentum (if they're any good or unless each episode is a self-contained story which this isn't). What did we know after two episodes of GoT? That Jaime and Cersei like a bit of the old nookie and aren't averse to pushing kids off buildings to hide their illicit liaisons. That, and there's some greebly stuff going on just beyond the wall. Upon introduction, not a single one of GoT's characters could be related to because we hadn't learned nary a thing about them yet. Most reviewers on here completely confound me. So far, HotD has recreated the world that John and Danaerys would later inhabit to a T. The political processes are equally intriguing and for those that forget, it was the political wheeling and dealing that made GoT so good in the first place. It was exactly the politics that brought upon the season's denouement that made season one so special: the separating of Ned's head from his neck.No one has any idea the quality of this first season of HotD because none of them have seen it. Save your reviews for either each episode or, if you want to review the season as a whole, watch the season as a whole.I shall return to this after the season ends to edit the score and provide my actual review. Thank you. Typing this has been marvellously exciting and filled me with great joy (not greyjoy. Lol, GoT puns. Gottem!)"
"First episode was pretty good, good introduction, alright action, and definitely a return to form for GOT. Hope the rest of the episodes will follow accordingly."
"This show has been a weekly event for me and my partner. He wasn't a huge fan of game of thrones or how that series ended, but loves this series. There is excellent writing and character development. It is a wonderful adaptations of characters and events from the work of George R. R. Martin. It somehow still manages to include surprises every week. Even with the changing of actors and actress through the season they always felt instantly identifiable and picked up right were the previous left off. Great casting all around! Masterful cinematography almost every week as well. Looking forward to even more in this story and the dragons!!!"
"Figuratively and actually, why is almost every scene shot in the dark? Can't compare this to GOT becuz there is NO comparison. I can't get a handle on what's going on; this thing is confusing, meandering; if there's a plot or storyline it's lost somewhere...never mind this thing is awful. I promised my brother I would give it a chance...won't be the first promise I ever broke. NONE of the charachters are defined ( probably bcuz we can't see any of them) Daemon was becoming interesting but now he's a dead beat dad while being with his family. He's a Nomad...why? I don't care, I really don't. I'm going to go and watch GOT to get the bitter taste of HOTD outta my mouth."
"I'll be honest, I was pretty turned off from the end of Game of Thrones. And it was tragic because, up to that point, it had been the best show on TV for so long. So in that regard, my initial interest level was fairly low when I heard about this prequel series. And then I saw the trailer and was intrigued enough to give it a try. I can say that House of the Dragon truly won me over. It had a lot to prove and redeem and it simply knocked it out of the park. The writing, acting, cinematography, visuals... all top notch. I love the story and the characters. Matt Smith's Daemon is a standout for sure, along with Paddy's Vaserys. I wouldn't be surprised if some awards are nabbed for this one."
"EDIT.I was underwhelmed at the beginning but after watching most of it, my opinion has changed.It's quite entertaining and it keeps GoT atmosphere and flavour. It has interesting characters and some of them are full of charisma.My main quibble with this show, it's that they are trying to compress years and years of plot in 8 episodes, when for the original GoT it was 8 seasons. Therefore, we had more time to know the characters and get invested. Plus, here the mystery factor that GoT had, is missing. And...why no one has mentioned Winter so far?Anyway, it's good enough and I don't regret watching."
"Not even close to Game of Thrones. The poor casting choices and boring episodes make it unwatchable. Most of the actors are obviously not a good fit or lack charisma.This is my first time rating a show lower because I love Game of Thrones, and an 8.5 rating on IMDB is a lie. I think it's only because it's on HBO Max and they have a lot of bots, like what others are saying. We don't really need to base a show's worth on ratings anymore.This show is a real disaster, and I had high expectations for it, but it's not awesome at all. They ruined it and I won't watch season 2 anymore. This is one of the worst series I've ever watched."
"While I had my reservations for this prequel, House of the Dragon does an exceptional job in keeping alive the spirit of Game of Thrones by bringing forth a whole new plot of conspiracies, interesting characters, unexpected twists, and most importantly, Dragons! I would love to see more of thrilling battles in the show and the entire story tying up with the Game of Thrones till the point that Robert Baratheon is crowned the King of the Seven Kingdoms and Daenerys is born. I absolutely loved that HotD kept the nostalgic opening anthem of GoT intact. Absolutely recommend all my fellow GoT fans out there not to miss out on the masterpieces this show has in store for us."
"Game of Thrones is, without a doubt one of the, if not the greatest TV show ever made. The wonderful book series was adapted to exception, whilst doing its own thing - providing eight wonderfully written, unrivaled complex and ever mature seasons.Spinoffs were on the horizon for a while, and whilst I was excited, I was prepared for something more of a cash-in, milking of a famous brand. But out of several ideas, what we got in the end was a loose-adaptation of another book in the universe, set hundreds of years before the original show, and something that stands as a great film on its own.The feeling of the original show is recreated wonderfully, without feeling at all like a retread. This is done with great passion, great complexity and with the same caliber in acting and writing. Like the original, it focuses more on power play and drama rather than action.Overall, simply a masterpiece, by no means a cash in on the brand, and beautifully put together! One of the best shows of all time for sure."
"Returning to a world you miss is dangerous, nothing is as good as the original.. but the world of Ice and Fire is an exception.We Westeros fans, from north of the Wall to winterfell, to King's Landing and Dorn, must rejoice in the fact that we have a great writer like George R. R. Martin, and a giant network like HBO giving us a sequel that is as great as the original, the details of this story remind us of a conflict that is no less exciting than the original story we saw in GOT.One of the most prominent aesthetic points in the opening of the series is choosing the appropriate actors as the main characters, and this point is important because the ongoing conflict requires maintaining the integrity of the conflicting characters in several aspects, the most important of which is the elaborate representative level, which will allow interaction between the character and us the fans, and what we witnessed in the first episode gave us the idea that the characters will make their mark in the this world.The music of the series is impressive, as usual, and is no less creative than the original series. This point was important in making the series, and any laziness in it would gave us a great disappointment.The narration of events in the first episode was a bit quick, but this is what we also witnessed in the opening of GOT, which means that we may watch the story go to other dimensions and with an appropriate narrative for all aspects of the story.We must rest assured that the returning to the environment of the continent and the capital itself is to restore the atmosphere of the original work and show us some safety as fans, and this was shown in several clips to show us the extent to which the series will go in parallel with GOT.The CGI in the work and the appearance of the dragons present us with good possibilities in this regard.In the end, the series is a wonderful new journey, that attracts those who haven't had a chance to enjoy great world of GOT yet."
"After GOT, everyone is comparing this show to it and they think is still ""cool"" to diss on GOT, move on people... they ruined it, it's over, let it go. See this show as a seperate thing entirely.And I personally love it. And I think we still haven't even seen the best parts yet, they are building it up in a way that makes sense, and you clearly see the characters motivations. It is a well developed story that just keepts getting better. People need to stop crying over a dead show, and watch this with fresh eyes instead.It hasn't even gotten to the dragons yet, and I like that they aren't making a big deal out of them yet. The story is amazing without them, it develops in a well timed manner, slower pace which makes sense, and I feel like towards the end when they bring in the dragons and the battles, it will really feel like a well rounded, developed story and complete. They are doing a great job!"
"We have to admit that the first episode had a lot to live up to, it would be very hard for it to live up to the expectation. And it did not disappoint, on account of - it did not live to any of the expectations.The story telling is dumped down. From the onset it goes on to tell you exactly what happened. It labels all the characters. Puts one trait to each of the characters, so we exactly know who are these people, what is on their agenda, what should be expected of them. And they all act exactly in accordance with what is expected of them. No arch, no internal struggle, no surprises.And, obviously, nothing is produced today which is not compliant with the agenda - a little girl, looked down, but ready to be a big man.I don't know what's next - we are just gonna go into a war? In any case, I will watch it, but...P. S. Also one can see few misplaced sex scenes and gutting of tournament participants. The last one was quite strange. It appears noble family members were participating in the tournament, so half of the future of the noble houses got eliminated on the tournament?...UPDATE >>> I downgraded my rating from 4 to 1. I think the honest rating would be 4-6, but I deliberately reduced it to 1 to counter the biased 9-10 ratings.UPDATE >>> Episode 9 >>> Upgraded my rating to 8!:)) Stand by my comments for first episodes, but the show has picked up a lot in later episodes! Good show!:)"
"Never thought I'd love again but... here I am.Fantastic writing, acting, costume and CGI in this and every other episode. I love that Sunday nights are exciting again. Can't believe that I am saying this after the blunder of season 8 of GOT. Pleasantly surprised though.Feeling the slow burn of conflict between former BFF R and A. Essentially book readers will know what will happen but it's still made so exciting by slight tweaks by the showrunners. Such a fantastic way of showing the downturn of such a prosperous and peaceful time in fictional history despite having a leader who seems kind and thoughtful overall. The feminist theme also throws for a unique aspect of this fictional history that we have all grown to love.Excellently crafted. Honestly."
"I echo what many people have said critically against this series. It's poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly edited, and it seems they've embarked on a path of no return already so that they will never get back to the story of the books.I almost didn't even bother with this series, given the incredible almost criminal demise of Game of Thrones over its last two seasons. D&D ran that show into the ground, and I made sure that had nothing to do with this one before watching.So I was excited and pumped to watch the first episode. Then I watched it and I was so disappointed. Almost nothing redeeming about it. Not one character that even remotely had me rooting for them, or even hating them.But I thought to myself, this is only the first episode, keep watching. So I watched the second episode, and I was disappointed in the exact same way. Then by the end of the third episode, well, now I have a statistical pattern with 2Â° of freedom.They chose to depart significantly already from the GRRM story, and I don't think they can recover from it. I predict the show gets canceled. In the name of diversity and a high ""woke coefficient"" they have literally sacrificed storytelling. As an example, it seems obvious the show runners cared more about having a black person play a Valerian, rather than intelligently through a well written script tell the audience what a Valerian is.And this is the main culprit. The script is awful. The acting on that script is awful. The editing by which the piece of story together is awful. The sets are not thawed out well at all, and apparently according to the show, the technology base is the same as it will be in 200 years.I will not be watching any more episodes. I've written this show off. It's just not worth watching. I suspect the people who think it is ""awesome"", or probably more or less the same sorts of people who thought season eight of GOT was awesome television.My goodness!Edit"
"I made it through episode nine and I'm definitely calling it quits. There's really not even one character left in the show that I care about. I wanted to love this, only because the producers of Game of Thrones had nothing to do with it, and I thought I would give HBO another chance to get it right. This show is a fail."
"Well that is a major weight lifted off my shoulders. Those who stick with GRRM's material, succeed. They pulled it off! This show does not feel forced, and sold out. It is authentic and feels like we are truly in Westeros. The Westeros we only knew as a whisper of history. The casting is excellent. The music is GOT. Great job HBO. Bravo!"
"The show will try to make us care who sits on the iron throne. I personally dont think I could care less. And I don't see how the show aspires to awake interest either.But given the garbage shows out there, this will always be a decent watch. The CGIs are going to be good, the dragons and war sequences are going to be appealing. But it definitely is not GoT. The casting, the dialogues, the acting, the plot or the characters themselves don't seem to command as much reverance as GoT did."
GOT succeeded because it had great characters and equally great stories as to why they were there. Brilliantly sharp dialogue for even minor characters showed how much effort went into that show.Over the opening series #1 you became invested in these characters because they were interesting and you wanted to know more about them.HOTD has none of this. 4 episodes in it is a dull as dishwater amateur night wannabee which should not be mentioned in the same breath as GOT.They use the same music but the opening sequence looks a cheap and nasty Asylum knockoff.It is not as well filmed and has none of the panoramic scope GOT had.We have seen a couple of locations mainly Kings Landing but nothing like the breadth the first series of GOT had.The main characters are uninteresting and bland whilst the dialogue is about as incisive as a feather duster.It only has two characters anything remotely interesting in Daemon and Rhaenyra and they are nothing to brag about.GOT had people who appeared for one or two episodes that were fuller rounded characters than any of this lot.The plot is pretty sparse and is jumping forward at a pace without any sense to it.The biggest crime it is guilty of is that after 4 episodes it is as boring as hell.I will stick with it for a bit more but if this is the best they can come up with I doubt I will make it to the end.
"With Milly Alcock dropped and replaced the show went south pretty darn fast.The script feels rushed and it's too complicated to be rushed.With the main character, who is carrying the whole show, gone there's no reason for me to continue watching.Although it started off pretty promising. But it just doesn't seem to be able to make the promise come true.There are a LOT of characters playing their fair bit but the back story behind those characters is never explained nor is there any effort to even attempt such thing.I myself are pretty disappointed and adjusted my earlier rating of 7 stars waayy down to a measly 3 stars."
"The cinematographic of the show is very well done, and beautiful. The design of the cities is very immense, and give you a scale idea of how big the battles, dragons, and story is going to be. The artwork done on the dragons is very well done giving each dragon their own unique look, and personality to them. This is an improvement from Game of Thrones dragons. The music is very well constructed giving the audience that medieval/fantasy feel when watching the show. The music in the show provides strength to the characters, and certain areas of the story that provide more indulging moments for you to look forward too. The Show provides you with many different character personalities as well. Ones that range from hero, villain, questionable, unworthy, backstabbing, and many more different character personalities. For anyone looking for a plethora of characters to follow, or be in favor of this show allows for that. With many different character personalities, many change throughout the episodes depending on certain changes within the story that continuously surprise you, and make you reconsider at times what the intent of the character is or will be."
"Apart from making you slightly depressed because of its harshness, story and underpinning world view, this series is excellent on all levels. To me, the characters and stories are even more mature than in Game of Thrones. However, in return the overall scope is a lot smaller, describing only the one house. Perhaps because of this, the series paints a masterful painting but uses a much narrower range of (mostly darker) colors to do so.Great casting, great acting, wonderful dialogs. Not a single character is flat or unrealistic. It is brilliant how all of them make completely understandable choices that inevitably lead the realm to the brink. Visuals and special effects are good and have the right balance of impressing the viewer but supporting the story. Good overall story and all of the underlying scenes are strong."
"After reading some of the reviews I was almost disappointed upfront. But no way! This show was great!!! I actually thought it was better than Game Of Thrones. Where GOT sometimes was very slow (and sometimes even a little bit dull) for me this was not the case with this show. Great acting too!It sucks you in en leaves you very very very impatient to wait for season 2.I also saw in an interview that R. R. Martin said there is not really a hero or a person to ""love"". I do not agree! I am a total fan of the new Princess/Queen.Conclusion: very good show, a must watch for GOT, dragons & blond hair lovers!"
"I'm a big fan of GOT and came to this sequel a little bit skepticalIn the first episodes I felt a bit confused and unsure of how the series was supposed to develop, it was hard for me to connect with the characters and the acting of most of the actors was lame.I think that it was only from the middle of the series, and especially after the change of the cast, that the series started to take off and reach the level of Game of Thrones.It's a bit hard for me to imagine the series without the king, he should definitely get an Emmy for his role, his scenes were unforgettable, especially the eye for an eye scene.I'm looking forward to the second season, it's just a shame that there's such a long wait between seasons, I'm considering waiting at least 2-3 whole seasons to continue watching.Another excellent series from HBO."
"First of all, to rate a show 1 star, it has to be aweful and i doubt anyone who watched the first episode would say that.It ruins whoever is debating whether to watch it or not.People are just hating for tiny stupid reasons. One reason was season 8 GOT ruined it for me and it won't be as good because of it. Another reason I saw was that a person put a 1 star review because he saw a black man with blonde wig?!Others saying it was a disappointing start because nothing happened. Keep in mind that there are alot of characters and this is just a start. Go back to GOT episode 1 and it is really similar. The storytelling was great and CGI was amazing and the shots were immaculate. The people who really understood the show will get that it's building up to a climax by the end of the season."
Uninteresting characters; Weak storytelling when compared with GoT pilot; Racial quotas ruins world building logic; Boring.GRRM work deserves better.
"I bet there is not even one character that you can like and support in this series.In the script somethings are happening that you may call them twists but actually they are not. Some unimportant characters are dying, sometimes even with an accident. They're just making similiar mistakes with the last two seasons in Game of Thrones. I am aware those logicless things happened also season five and six but you could ignore those. Real nonsense things started in Season Seven in my opinion. I know in HOTD there is not really big mistakes that we can call it nonsense. But instead I'm just calling them unnecessary.You don't need to put fake twists in the script. Actually I don't even care anyone dies in the series. Everyone can die and I won't be sad at all. There is no character that we can be with him/her. And I think there won't be. I can't see which characters will evolve like Jaime Lannister? None.Not just the characters or the storyline is unnecessary but the techincal details are too bad for an HBO show.Too bad color grading, not that great cinematography, VFX is quite good but sometimes looks horrible. Even the scores are much worse than Game of Thrones, I'm happy they're using old scores sometimes. Makeup, sound, costume design and set decoration is really good but not surprisingly good."
"The reason that it goes so fast is because they need to get to the main topic. The main topic is the fight between Rhaenyra and Aemond or Aegon for the iron throne. That's the dance of dragons and the worst battle that ever happened in Westeros. They needed to show how everything developed, but they couldn't give it more time because they need to get to the war between the characters. Several characters in got spoiled the ending and talked about this battle because it marked the history of Westeros. The show is really good: the actors, script, and the direction. It could have more light, but the show is good."
"This is not your Benioff and Weis Game of Thrones. This is something very different. It is clearly going to be much more linear in story telling. Less characters, less locations, less scenery and really just one plot. Finally, the casting is a heavy departure from GoTRegarding the single plot, linear story. GoT was...let's say confusing...but I personally felt the confusion was a good thing in GoT. We got more and more out of it each time we watched it again. Each episode moved around. In some ways they were their own stories and each were very good, well writted with rich characters and locations. This show (unless they do something very radical in future episodes) looks to be about digging into one set of characters. I expect there won't be anymore surprise deaths of beloved characters like Ned Stark. I don't get the feeling we're meant to fall in love with these people only to lose them. So thiis is a much more traditional series. It would seem.For me, this is not what I expected, so my initial rating is low for my expectations. We only saw KIngs Landing really. There were no questions to wonder about until the next episode to keep us all talking and wondering.There's nothing so interesting as Peter Dinklage's Tyrion Lanester character or The Hound or literally any interesting character. They are all just who you expect them to be. There was nothing very funny nor exciting, nor unexpected about the first episode. Nothing to look forwards to like finding some dire wolf pups. There's literally nothing putting you on the edge of your seat for next week. No questions like ""who are the white walkers?"" No intrigue like ""who killed Jon Arron"" (sp)So what happened to kick of this Game of Throne's series? The greatest drama series of all time in many opinions. Well not too much. The queen dies in childbith, sorry that's not very shocking. The king names his daughter as his successor. Also not shocking since the show is clearly about her. A title character without the title. Another departure from GoT. We had no idea who the main characters really were in GoT and the was part of the beauty of it. And after a few seasons, you knew that anyone could die at any moment. Both shocking and nerve wracking for literally everyone both the audience and the performers!So this seems to be a kinder gentler Game of Thrones. I see no longevity here. Perhaps it is meant to be a limited series. Tell the story of this young lady and end it. Ok, fine I guess. Wouldn't have been my choice to followup the greatest drama of all time, but sure, whatever.My final comment is about the casting. No one we know really. No one new that's going to shock everyone. The princess is wholely unremarkable and she needed to not be. She needed to be Emilia Clarke 2.0 and she's just not. We empathized with Danny right from the first scenes in GoT. Not here. This was a swing and a miss. Too plain, no presence and not her fault, no rich and powerful story to help out the young antress. The other characters are just as plain, their attributes telegraphed and easy to guess. Perhaps the lackluster writing is the reason there's not anyone with real acting chops involved. I make an exception in part for Rhys Ifans who is a very good actor, but even he could not make the content shine. And I know they are all good actors, but there will unfortunately be no new stars coming from this show. No careers launched like so many in the original.And yes, for you Matt Smith fans out there, he's also a fine actor. And he just might be able to save this series. But time will tell, the first episode stated clearly that his character is not known to be the protagonist, antigonist, hero or anti-hero. This was yet another poor choice in my opinion. If his character had been truly terrible or terrifying, that would have been something at least. Perhaps something that might be redeemed later. Or not. Jamie Lanister was a story of rememption.What was in this first episode to come close to rivalling GoT S1E1? Some incest? No. A lovable character like Hodor? No. Witty writting? No. Something/Anything we never seen before? No. Any burning questions? No Just something new and exciting or interesting or controversial. NO. NO. NO. None of that.After watching the GoT S1E1 people were on their phones and social media going, Jees, did you see that? I gotta watch that again!After watching House of the Dragon S1E1, the audience went to bed and got ready for work on Monday.But we (and yes I too) will watch this new show for nothing more than to get the opportunity to live for a moment in the past when Game of Thrones was a sensation, and you read the books even though Martin could drone on about nohting for 100 pages and we all just could not get enough of it. This is not that. It is a very faint, predictable, and unremarkable opportunity to remember back when Winter was coming."
"Very bad acting, uninteresting conversations, scenes look really cheap, time stretching and empty compared to game of thrones. GOT was very immersive. House of the Dragon really lost my interest quite fast. No fascinating story or characters. I think 2/10 is still generous.. Just because you add some boob or gore scenes here and there doesn't make the series good at all. I won't waste my time on this.."
"It's nice that they got George RR Martin on board but there was so much goodwill lost after GoT's final season. GRRM's struggle to produce The Winds of Winter further compounded that problem. These would be the 2 main points of contention for most potential viewers of House of the Dragon.Well, I can confidently say that I'm floored at how well they've managed to pull this off. I'll spare any major plot details from episode 1 but the direction the story seems to be going is solid. Episode 1 is fast-paced narratively speaking. We understand almost every major player's motivation by the end.Tonally, this is as close as the screen has ever gotten to GRRM's vision. The world feels more than lived in, characters behave with agency and have real human motives. This is a serious show. There's no room for brain dead quips or on-the-nose hints at the audience about real-world politics. These are characters living in their own world. The dialogue is also far closer to the source material.Paddy Considine's Viserys is a particular surprise, for me. He always came across as incompetent in Fire and Blood. However, in House of the Dragon, he has agency, is extremely flawed and ultimately a human being. Matt Smith's Daemon Targaryen will be a fan favourite, no question. A bold and unruly figure who steals each scene he appears in. My personal favourites so far would be Eve Best's Rhaenys and Milly Alcock's Rhaenyra. Two women on opposite spectrums of feminine maturity yet both seem to be kindred spirits in other aspects.For those with any doubts or hesitance at potential 'wokeism' and forced diversity, honestly there's little to worry about based on my first impressions. Like many book fans, I feared for the direction of the story with the changes to House Velaryon. However, it's safe to say these fears don't appear to have much weight. They clearly stand out amongst the sea of white Lords of Westeros but they also seem to 'fit' and not forced. Steve Toussaint, I have to say, has the presence and the chops to play a more than worthy Sea Snake. Of course, it's still early days and we'll see where this road leads but for now, the signs are positive.Finally, the *dragons*. We saw just a couple in episode 1 but wow! They *feel* weighty and certainly real. The CGI is phenomenal, this VFX is destined to win a few awards. I'm quite intrigued by how they'll be depicted once more are on screen and definitely in battles.Overall, this is a worthy successor to Game of Thrones. Especially seasons 1-4. The world is lived in, it's brutal and unforgiving. George's vision of flawed and grey characters is certainly visible for all to see. It's a wonderful first entry in a show brimming with potential and one I could see even outdoing its predecessor in due time.If you love ASoIaF, WATCH THIS SHOW!"
"The storyline , costumes, music , cgi all of these were 10/10 no doubt. The acting was amazing but there would be more space for other actors to perform better , it would be seen in the next episodes to come. All GOT fans what they wished they have gotten, violence , dragons , politics all in one and more than that Targaryens.The complete show is an wonderful art 10/10."
"And that's why, although S1 in HotD isn't bad at all and I really enjoyed it, but it keeps giving you the feeling that it is building a novel, the whole season sounds like an Introduction, this can be achieved without giving the audience this feeling, GOT's first season did that, but without the feeling that this is only an intro, you can watch s1 of GOT and feel it is a standalone story, and you will actually get emotions with each character, HotD won't give you that, it only give you the feeling that something amazing is going to happen, it would be much better if instead these whole 10 episodes were shrunk into 7-8 episodes. And then get some action in last 2 episodes. This at least will give you the feelings that this is a complete standalone story that will accelerate."
"In starting you will feel bored, but as the show keep going on the story built it self. I would recommend the show. The VFX of the starting episodes were some what not good but by the end of the season it was convincing.The VFX is disappointing in the starting of the show. The story takes a turn in later episodes and the story feels like Game of thrones prequel, there are lot of dragons in this series, some of them feel like cartoon dragons. The actors are also beautiful and handsome, and their acting looks promising and incredible.Watch the show and feel the thrill and adventure. In last it's a must watch series."
"I have just finished my rewatch of house of the dragon and it was even better the second time round. This series has so much going for it from great character's to epic action sequences to political intrigue the show never leaves you board. The acting in this show is stellar all the performances are incredible especially Paddy Consadine, if he doesn't get a Emmy I will riot.The Game of thrones is at the for front again which is great to see. Considering that fire and blood is a history book the writers have done a incredible job with their adaptation.Somethings about this show I like even more than game of thrones. This is controversial. It is to early to say which one will be better as comparing a show with 8 seasons compared to 1 will always be unfair but I noticed I grew more quickly attached to these charterers than the ones from GOT. I believe this is because it's less grande and more focused on one location. For me this means that as there are less characters its more focused, the show really benefits from this. While game of thrones was great for how large it was I enjoy this series more intimate feeling more.The problems I have with this show is that it needs more episodes. The time jump is extremely jarring and even more so on the rewatch. Episode 5 is probably the worst episode to do a time jump from as so many plot lines are left open and the viewer just has to make up their own ending for them which is frustrating but I don't believe this to be a problem with the writers team but more a problem with HBO not giving them more than 10 episodes for most likely budget reasons. This is why the season is nearly perfect. Even with all that said once you get past that little hiccup the rest of the season gets even better.Overall I rate this series a 10/10 while not quite perfect I believe this series has so much potential and season 1 is a great set up season for what's to come. Let the dance commence."
"I settled down to watch this with scepticism because I have trouble with prequels that don't have original characters, but I soon warmed to these guys, whom are excellent. Millie is great, hope she returns in some flash backs. High production value, great reconstruction/imagining for the dance of dragons.Matt Smith plays shady like he loves it, glad he gave up on his football dream to act. I couldn't take my eyes off him. Olivia Cooke has come a long way, a lucky break into stardom after being rejected by drama schools, I bet they are kicking themselves.Can't wait for the next season, please keep millie."
"Here we go, prime example of overrated, or exagarated reviews. It was so obvious it was going to get 10's even if it had 1 Actor walking to the moon it would of still got 10's.To me personally, except for the Dragon it did not feel like GOT, no likeable characters except maybe the lead, boring / Dull story.This felt more like a Spartacus reboot than Got, especially the brothel scenes.The main characters look as though they should be in The Witcher.This being said, my realistic score is 6/10 hope it becomes more interesting in the weeks to come.Infact, first episode has made me believe that Rings of Power is going to smash this."
As a fan Of the novel I will say that this is incredibly faithful and if you like the novel and you will definitely like this serious also I do think. It took me a little To Get into the series but once I did I was on board and the time jumps were very cool and interesting And overall it's a very Violent And gory t v series They did a really good job of adapting this TV series into show. I highly recommend this T v series And there are times when the show can get very intense and real and I loved every single second of it Also there are nice references and nods that set up the future Can't wait for the next season.
"God, this is levels of watching paint dry. As I watch, I imagine every single character as one of those cardboard cutouts being puppeteered around.Nobody could be vested in this plot, because there isn't one, and everyone is so unlikeable that you honestly don't care what happens.The first half of the season is listening to a girl whine about how unfair everything is and the second half is the same but she's a woman.Emma D'Arcy's stone-faced acting makes Kristen Stewart look dynamic. Meanwhile, Matt Smith hams it up every chance he gets--as some sort of meld between the Joker and Dr. Who. Sometimes he looks like he's about to break into a ""Hello My Ragtime Gal"" song and dance number using his sword as a cane. Man., he gets so tedious, but at least someone is trying not to be a mannequin? ...Like the *entire* rest of the cast.No, just no. No."
"Tedious, full of tropes and utterly unengaging.Boring characters saying things that have been said time and time and time again.'This is your birthright... blah, blah, blah.''We have ruled these lands... blah, blah, blah.''We have to do this for the throne... blah, blah, blah.'WHO CARES???!!!!!And am I alone in being totally alienated by the way cruelty and violence is glamourised in this show? I'm not looking for this level of sadism in escapist fiction. I find the morality questionable at best.Great production values and wonderfully shot though. Which I guess is what brings in viewers superficially. I'll give them that."
"There is no substance. They leave you with a glimmer of what the story can develop into which doesn't seem all that interesting.GOT has so many stories lines and characters inter-weaving, so much content but this is just one uninteresting story.Idk how many times we got up and started do misc. Chores intermittently while watching this show, and it's cgi is very poor."
"I really love this series, everyone good and bad people but they're have reason why what they did,not many action screen, but every character skip,I can't take out of my eye away from this series,everything they said is a lot meaning,I am a book fan but still surprised me everytimes. I praise the writer title.now is EP8 and this episode is the best for me,so many emotions and I was cried for this episode.not any air time,if you focus every words then you will feel like me,I hope season2 can still keep this good along and please believe me,you must watch this series ,this is best series for me OMG I love it a lot."
"If you don't like this you probably love Marvel movies. The usual and obvious is not the focus. I love the way they ""dwell"" on scenes. Life is lived in those few moments, that feel like hours. Game of Thrones is remembered for its moments, not the entire narrative. This one is just moments, no narrative.The depth is probably 10X of GoT, and makes the latter feel like a children's book now.The art direction, music, editing, cinematography all is Oscar level, not just Emmys. The first few episodes felt a bit scattered and shallow, but once Rhaneyra grows up.. oh my!I can now relate to each and every character, even the young princes and princesses. Even those that I almost found repulsive in the earlier episodes.Not more to be said, this one is one of the best things ever to have hit the small screen.Can't wait for Season 2. And really hope this carries on for 10 seasons at least and doesn't end up as an anti-climax the way GoT did."
"We ALL know how GOT ended what the final battle was all about. So all of these ""critics"" on here are shaming it because of what? No Whitewalkers? Is that what you wanted? This is a PREQUEL! Stop expecting the same storyline as what you previously saw. You all sound like a bunch of spoiled brats."
"House of the Dragon is the canonical prequel to the world's favourite fantasy television series, Game of Thrones, itself an adaptation of 'A Song of Ice and Fire' from George RR Martin and further showing that there's plenty of room for Westeros to grow on the small screen inside and out of the Stark, Baratheon and Lannister Families.Sure this series is a slower burner than Game of Thrones' best stories, but it's not deadbeat boring or monotonous; instead House of the Dragon has a more singular focus on the Targaryen Family some 170+ years before Daenerys changed the fate of The Seven Kingdoms forever. And this shift to singular family stuff is a far cry from the world-sprawling and 'character-jumping' seen in Game of Thrones, but it still works because we're seeing more of Westeros' unspoken history play out on the screen.House of the Dragon has stuff that plays RIGHT into viewers' expectations yet there's also stuff that's far-fetched from their expectations too. And though it's a prequel, there's not a SINGLE familiar face in sight and keeps the story safe from 'prequelitis' where you KNOW one of the characters is gonna be okay in the end. Everyone's drawn from new blood here, and we're gonna see how it ties to the Game of Thrones show before the show is over.Overall, though the show isn't medium-shattering entertainment (yet) like Game of Thrones turned out to be, House of the Dragon is a nice return to a world we were clearly not over with. We're back in the Westeros playbook; and we're gonna see more stuff that's diving deeper into the world we grew to love in the first place.House of the Dragon may please some; it may frustrate some; but it's an earnest Game of Thrones continuation giving us assurances that Season 8 was not the end of the story by a long shot.This relatively brand new show is a hit. Maybe not for EVERYONE, but for those who were aching for more Westeros, it's a welcome addition to our beloved world. 4/5 stars."
"This show has a lot to live up to after the huge success of GOT. Based on episodes 1-8, they sure are getting all the best ratings from what they are giving us. It gets better every episode. It gets me excited every week to wake up and find out it's Sunday. I won't be like the others who has a lot of suggestions because whatever they are doing right now is perfect and and I just want them to continue that great story.One of the great things as well about the show is the cast - I can't think of any other person playing their roles than the current actresses and actors. I'm sure this show will also get a lot of awards."
The best game of thrones backstory ever made . It's all making sense of where the dragons came from and how woman bounded with dragons and where the game of thrones began . I hope to see where the dragons go and where the ice war starts.
"The characters are the least interesting thing about this show. This is meant to be an exciting time in the history of this madly beautiful made up world but for some unknown reason I feel tired everytime I watch it. Not sure what can improve after 4 episodes, maybe bring back the folks who made the predecessor. I hope it gets better like a fine wine but every episode is making want to watch game of thrones and forget this show ever existed. I hope I am very wrong about this show and it turns out to be a masterpiece but my gut as fat as that maybe is telling me it won't be and will forever be forgotten in the sands of time. I believe the missing ingredient is balls and the want to shock the audience, that's what we all want and deserve. Thanks for reading this."
This is the best series I have seen. From episode 1 it takes you away to the magic place of GOT. The only thing I wish was for the story to go a bit slower. Almost every episode comes with time jumps of years. And the change of cast mid season was a bit disappointing. But the new actors manage to keep the characters as they were. I don't know how big the budget was but every episode is kind of epic in production quality. I have never seen anything like this on tv except for GOT. It's a bloody mess in a good way. You can't do anything but love it. Let's hope the next season manages to keep the this momentum and I look forward to the war for the throne!
"Pilot episodes are hard. You have to introduce everything, make people care about it and tell a story too. But even when taking that into account ""Heirs"" is bad.*The Problems*First of all, there is too much exposition - especially for a prequel. Martin loves naming things a bit too much and they should've shown more restraint here. Also giving every other character an ""ae"" in their name is awful.The CGI is shockingly poor. The dragons look alright but the buildings look like a video game. I have no idea why they decided to do aerial shots if they couldn't afford to make them look good.Then there is the issue of Matt Smith. He's a perfect Doctor Who but terribly miscast as a violent hedonist. He is too goofy to be menacing.Another problem is that some things really don't make sense. The dragon keepers, the ones maintaining the most important weapons, look filthy and poor. People didn't get killed on purpose during real-life tournaments and they definitely wouldn't kill nobles. The summary execution also made no sense from a practical POV.The worst part was the violent birth. We really really really didn't need to see that. I love bloody violence but this was just exploitative.*The Rest*There were some redeeming elements. The physical production value is amazing. Most of the acting was good. The girls, played by Alcock and Carey, really carry the episode. And there's still some promise to it all. Let's hope this was just a false start."
"The fact that this show has an 8.6 rating reeks of some kind of corporate maneuvering. I'm seeing predominantly negative reviews here that echo my own feelings. This show is terrible!! Stiff, self-conscious, and contrived. They think they're creating high drama but none of it is believable, or even engaging, for a second. Where do I begin? Alicent and Rhaenyra are supposedly deep childhood friends, but all that is ruined because Rhaenyra slept with early MAGA prototype Criston Cole? And then later, the entire realm clutches its pearls because Rhaenyra's kids don't look like Laenor? Seriously? On the far superior early Game of Thrones, none of Robert Baratheon's kids looked like him while twins Cersei and Jamie were banging each other since childhood, and literally no one cared because it was all part of a much larger and thoroughly engrossing world.The HOTD writers fail completely at creating high stakes and building tension between characters. It's simply not there. Alicent walks around with a horrified look on her face all the time and it's so annoying because there's nothing to be horrified about! Rhaenyra isn't even mean to her! In one episode, Rhaenyra even offered to wed their two families together, which would have solved everything, but instead of even considering it, Alicent just scowls inexplicably. And then of course, we are treated to multiple time jumps and cast changes that stretch over years, and the entire time, you have the feeling that nothing is happening. People just sort of wander from room to room spouting boring dialogue and there are suggestions of past conflict but other than the big fight amongst the kids (a rare high point in this show), you don't see it and therefore you don't really feel it.This show is strictly Game of Thrones fan fiction amateur hour. The creators obviously have a lot of reverence for GRRM's work and are trying really hard not to mess things up. But in so doing, they fail to conjure the best qualities of the original: the wild, distinctly well-drawn characters; the high stakes and the clear motivations; the sprawling locations and complex plot lines; the nuanced relationships, like the one between Arya and the Hound. So much glorious mess in the original, so much buttoned-down nothingness here."
Special mention to the wirintng and camera work
Excellent pilot episode which increases curiosity for the upcoming episodes.....can't ask for better prequel than this ðŸ˜€
Opening credits is a bit disappointment.
"People calling this show boring or a soap opera are genuinely delusional and only expect action like S7 and 8 of GoT. It's called CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT idiots. All of season 1 is one big prologue to the upcoming war that will break out and so far it has been completely faithful to the book that it's based on. Everything these people are waiting to see will happen, literally just give it time to develop. The villains, the drama, the REAL plot will all unfold but these characters that everyone call ""boring"" need time to be developed, it's only been 4 episodes calm down karens. This period of Westeros is a very complex and detailed war with hundreds of character, so give. It. Time."
"At first I was skeptical about this series. I really liked Game of Thrones until the showrunners ran out of the original material (the books) and they had to make up the script for season 8 which was a huge let down since the quality of the show plummeted. Characters dying left and right to finish plot lines, people (Stanis) acting totally out of character etc.But I was totally wrong. The show is set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones and focuses on the story of House Targaryen.The series is gorgeous. Like GoT is full of political turmoil, with a fabulous cast of characters, really nice acting and dialogue and a strong narrative that is necessary to move the huge number of characters involved. During the show, as time passes, a handful of the characters are recast as adults but I think all the recasts are decent and the actors really shine in their roles. Special mention to the awesome role by Paddy Considine as King Vyserys and Matt Smith as his brother Daemon.Action scenes are well done as its CGI (mainly dragons). They are not overused and mainly introduced when needed by the story.Totally recommend the show if you like political intrigue and specially if you are a fan of Game of Thrones."
"What in 7 Hells? Just watch it. If it please M'Lords.Absolutely the BEST tv series made this year. The writers must be Absolutely laughing their heads off at The rings of power now. Fantastic story line so far. The actors are all great in their respective roles.Matt Smith, AKA Number 11, AKA the best Doctor to ever grace our telly's plays 'Prince Daemon Targaryen'. Who rides the Dragon 'Caraxes'. He really brings justice to the role, anger and jealous. It's brilliant to see the house of Targaryen in a little bit of turmoil.Targaryens, Dragons, a man who feeds people to an army of Crabs and Matt Smith with long, beautiful, silver hair. What more could you want?Really, really, good watch, so far. You'll be glued to the screen. And I'll say this once and once and once only. ""What do we say to 'The Rings of Power? Not today."
"House of Dragon is a remarkable TV series that stands shoulder to shoulder with its predecessor, Game of Thrones. The storytelling and plot twists in this captivating show are nothing short of remarkable, leaving audiences in awe with each episode.Just like its predecessor, House of Dragon weaves a complex narrative filled with political intrigue, power struggles, and unexpected turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The writers have masterfully crafted a world that is both familiar and fresh, drawing us into a rich tapestry of compelling stories that unfold with jaw-dropping twists and turns.The cast of House of Dragon is a testament to the talent and dedication of the actors involved. Each performer brings their unique charisma and skill to their respective roles, breathing life into the diverse and complex characters. Their performances are captivating, making us emotionally invested in the struggles and triumphs of these individuals.With its gripping storytelling, remarkable plot twists, and talented ensemble cast, House of Dragon proves itself to be a worthy successor to the throne. It is a must-watch for fans of Game of Thrones and newcomers alike, offering a fresh and exhilarating journey into the world of Westeros."
"This eposide is greater than previos . This episode shows that there is between greatness and madness his hair, the king suffers, his daughter suffers, and the king's assistant plays as he wants. The king's assistant's daughter became as provocative as she should be and began to show signs of hostility. I love this eposide It's not just a war. The Coriolis family appears in a wonderful way and the appearance of the dragon is one of the best scenes. The soundtrack is wonderful and epic that matches the beauty of the episode. It can not be described, but it pushed the events of the series forward and increased the dilemma between the characters."
"If the ending of Game of Thrones left a sour taste in your mouth just know that HOTD is extra strength mouthwash. Now it wasn't perfect by any means there are a few nitpicks but the Story the set design the acting and the cgi are all top tier and left me wanting more. And for the doubters just know D&D the men responsible for botching the ending to GOT are nowhere near this project George is involved directly and it is based on an already completed work. If you're that cynical just spoil the ending for yourself to see if its good or not.Overall I am excited to see where this show goes and I think a vast majority of people will enjoy it. If you hate powerful people of color or women though like a lot of these one star reviews show, maybe stick to The Birth of a Nation."
"So it's ok, not great. Where's the blood, the violence, the sex, the nudity? Where's the elements from Game of Thrones that made it so great as a show. Surprising the audience every week with gruesome brutality like nothing really ever seen. Suspenseful and raw.This unfortunately is none of those. This is a watered down version of Game of Thrones. Ok so there has been a little bit of graphic violence. A little bit of blood. Not much. Hardly any sex or nudity. No shocking moments or real suspense.There's some cool dragon stuff but when that's pretty few and far away.All in all yes it's ok. Not great. Pretty d**n boring actually."
"It feels like we're in an age of entertainment where scriptwriters aren't able to craft interesting characters or stories. However, as most of the source material is already done here by GRR it feels much more cohesive than many other big budget shows. The characters and dialogue don't match up to Season 1-4 of Game of Thrones but they still remain true to form in their interactions. It's hard to surpass Sean Bean and the host of other amazing actors of the original series. The visuals are amazing for the budget as well, and we've yet to see the most interesting parts of the time period they've chosen to focus on. Overall, it's a solid show and deserves the highest rating possible because it's an outlier in an era of hack writers and big budget disasters."
"I was really enjoying this show and was very invested in the characters and the actors playing them, especially Milly Alcock who I thought was outstanding.. such a strange decision to change everything in episode 6 and I can't imagine what it would have been like had that happened in Game of Thrones, surely fans would have been up in armsGame of Thrones has so many narrative threads also, of which House of the Dragon would have been one .. this show really felt like it was going somewhere but then episode 6 is like a reset and the same ground is covered again.. many characters don't look or behave at all like their younger selves which is not true to life, especially Rhaenyra goes from being super spirited to completely lifeless and resignedAlso some things make no sense.. for example a knight is allowed to bash someones brains out at a wedding party without any consequence.. surely he would have been executed. Instead he freely walks out has time on his hands to nearly perform seppuku, and gets a promotionI am also not sure why they use the Game of Thrones music in the opening/closing of the show since this is a different show with a different feel, and deserves an alternative theme or arrangementOn the plus side lots of really beautiful ambient sound, as good if not better than Game of Thrones."
"As many critics and fans alike would agree, the original GOT seasons 1-6, and elements of 7 was some of the best television ever produced. Yet so far House of the Dragon is a mere shell of GOT's prior greatness.It all starts with the casting. I myself am a person of color and I can't stress enough that forced diversity is ruining this show. Contrary to the popular narrative that the original GOT was devoid of diversity, people of color were cast in large numbers (no need to take my word for it, simply go back a rewatch any season). But more importantly in the original the best actor/actress fitting the character as written got cast. I mean how often do you watch a series where each character, whether they're good bad rich poor kind or insufferable, we found them all relatable. Now House of the dragon does have several characters that cast appropriately (Daemon/Matt Smith being one, I think he's doing a great job), but from a general sense the casting just feels off.Outside of the casting, the style of story telling used here for House Of The Dragon is not that entertaining. Without the GOT labels behind this, it's merely a documentary of re-enacted medieval history at selected points in time. I'm ok with the time jumps and fewer battles as this series, so far, takes place during an era of general peace. But the original GOT constantly gave you detailed character arcs, multiple perspectives, both fast and slow paced drama, cleaver conversation, immersive scenery, charisma, empathy, and the all important musical score! Every GOT fan I've ever interacted with always commented on how great the score was throughout and how the different themes were used to perfection (Warrior of light, Son Of The Harpy, Mother of Dragons, The Rains Of Castamere!) With The House Of The Dragon we get very little and in the few moments where it's included in the scene, it's mostly dull and forgettable. That said I'm left wondering wonder why this doesn't get brought up more often.Ultimately I'm going to hold out hope for this show. Great potential here and no doubt the Targaryen blood line and the complexities of this house is a big draw. Hope is that future episodes/season get back to their original brand of GOT story telling."
This show is silly bad with lazy ham writing. However Matt Smith is magnetic on screen and is desperately trying to save this hack show. The only things really worth watching are his scenes. The writers should spin off and do a series only about him. The guy is an adventurer he would have more than enough idea content.
"I know a lot of people complain about the slowness of the show. But I think it's fantastic to see the early stages of the houses and the characters we all love and hate in GoT. But in all honesty, It's hard to watch the dark scenes of the show (literally dark locations at night). I have tried to watch it on my OLED TV, on my iPad, on my phone on my MacBook Pro, and no matter how bright I set the screen, sometimes I can barely see what's happening! Screens should be invisible and let the people get immersed in the story, not in the realism of the lighting. Sometimes the same scene has two different light settings (one a little bit brighter), and you can appreciate so many details when that happens. I'm not a hardcore fan of the show, but I like it and want to enjoy it where I am with the device I have. Is that too much to ask? Am I the only one feeling that way?"
"Season 1 House Of The DragonI didn't go into this show with high expectations after GOT S8 and to say I was made to eat my words.I loved the world that this show has built, the characters are all so entraining, the show is in my opinion not orientated around action but the internal struggle of the Targaryen families, and for me that's my favourite aspect of it all.The first 5 episodes we are set with the ""kids"" and how they juggle the struggle of being the centre of the realm, at the start of the show I really liked Rhenerya and what she wanted from life, the later episodes I was drawn to Alyson and how she dealt with being the Queen consort it was so good, is she the villian is she not I think that's totally down to interpretation. Daemon was great start to end and lifts the suspense in every scene he enters ! King Viserys was hands down award winning !! Paddy brought so much to his character struggling with being king and his family hating each other !!I would have liked to see a little more action especially the war that is coming I thought we would have gotten that this season, also I would like in the future seasons a little more dragons.I rated all the episodes of the season either 8 or 9 and it fell as a solid 8.5/10 for me !!! A super season and I'm so excited for the rest of this show !!!"
"It feels more like westeroes like Got did. The cgi, massive spectacle world, acting, the dragons with their own personalities, everything is so good. MUST WATCH."
This show has more potential than the GOT. The background score feels new as well as giving a touch of GOT flavour. The cast is better than expected. Good start to a great show.
"That first episode was great and in my opinion it will be the most watched episode in the world because the first episode was great. I think that he will blow up all the upcoming series without a doubt and will occupy the first place in the ratings because it is a masterpiece, what we saw in the first supplement is an expression of the greatness that history will witness."
"Edit: 6 episodes in and nothing really happened yet. No character development. Silly story. Just irrelevant monologue after irrelevant monologue. I don't know how some people enjoyed this.It's not a bad series. The acting is mediocre, not bad, not good, but story is just boring.There are only a few episodes out and maybe I'm been too harsh already, but House of the Dragon is appearing to be another 10 season monologue series in medieval times, where the targaryens only rule because they have dragons. And that's it.But this can't have the same rating of shows like Breaking Bad. It just can't. It's plain boring."
It was a very good first episode and some of the characters are intriguing. Well acted by all and beautiful production.I'm keen to watch the next episode. That's all I wanted.
"It definitely did not start strong. Actors played very amateurishly, script is average. There is no way this tv series deserved 9.1 rating it has today. I think HBO wanted to make more money out of the franchise but its my feeling watching the first episode it will fail spectacularly."
"I got to episode 6 and decided life was way too short to watch something this mind numbingly stupid, so I read reviews and recaps for episodes 7-10 and called it a day.Since I haven't read the source book (Fire and Blood) I can only surmise that HBO didn't stray too far from it, but whether it was their interpretation that was lacking or it was GRR who wrote such shallow characters (save for Ser Otto) I'll probably have to take a peek at the book itself.Bottomline is the director told a rushed story, where almost all important interactions and confrontations were either abruptly transitioned to or they made sure it happened off screen; like when Daemon stole the dragon egg. We only ever saw these characters talk and talk and then talk some more. Daemon and Corlys went to war with the crab eaters but the audience only saw it in abstract. Apart from Daemon in the first half and Aemond in the second, no other character convincingly rose above the shallow foundation laid out by the show's creators and screen writers.In GoT the production team had enough time to establish secure footing and foundation for the different families in the seven kingdom. Here all we see are petulant characters who don't seem all that comfortable with each other despite what the director tried to convey. It was a classic case of telling and not showing. All the characters ever did was talk us to death.I know there will be civil war in season two. Whether it will be another season of tell and not show where we get the news of important activities only after they've happened off screen, then only time will tell."
"What can I say for this series? An absolute masterpiece! The characters are so well written, the actors were perfect for the roles, making them irreplaceable to my eyes, the story was interesting and nothing was predictable. A true successor to the Game of Thrones in terms of script quality and character depth. The visuals in rare occasions weren't as good, but that happened once or twice, overall the visuals and the CGI were outstanding especially on modern screens. When I first saw the trailer I thought it would be yet another bad attempt to milk a popular franchise, with low effort put into it, but I was mistaken and I'm so glad I was proven wrong! Gave it a 9/10 only for the second season to hopefully be even better and surpass the first almost flawless season! Can't wait for what's coming next!"
"After the somewhat disappointing ending to Game Of Thrones, we have waited a long time for the spinoff show House of the Dragon. The first season of the show has just finished and here is my review for it. The premise of the show is set almost 200 years before Game Of Thrones and sees the House of Targaryen in charge of the 7 kingdoms and having to deal with all the conflict that comes with that.Main Character"
Milly Alcock & Emma D'Arcy play the young and older version of Rhaenyra Targaryen and they are both fantastic. Alcok creates this really interesting young character and she is just enigmatic on screen and I don't know why but she was one of the best parts of the show. When D'Arcy took over the role she did a great job on building on the hard work that Alcok did and feel like an older version of this character. She is just really charismatic on screen and even though I wasn't a huge fan of the time jump she did a great job.Supporting Characters
"This is one of the biggest supporting characters that you will ever see, so I definitely won't mention everybody but everybody is fantastic in this show and delivers really strong performances. Matt Smith plays Daemon Targaryen and he is probably the best part of the show, he is so charismatic and he owns the screen in every scene that he is in. The character has so much development and intrigue of the show that seems to have earnt him much praise and love from the fandom. Rhys Ifans plays Otto Hightower and he is certainly one of the more manipulative and conniving members of the cast. This character reminds me the most of the best characters from GOT and seeing him try and manipulate the situation is interesting to watch. Paddy Considine plays King Viserys Targaryen and he is fantastic, you see this man try and control this whole situation that he is put in and Considine nails it, especially throughout the time jump where he has to give very different performances.Story"
"The story of the show is interesting. It documents some of the events that we were told about in GOT and seeing this rich lore come to life, the plotting and scheming is there and when it really gets into it, it really hits the high notes. The issue is mainly about the amount of content that is attempted here, the infamous time jumps have been an issue for me and made it sometimes hard to care about these characters. Also the finale didn't feel as high stakes as I think it should have done, which is a bit disappointing.Script"
The script is really good. The writing is strong and the characters are much better written here. It is a very serious show with only a few sprinkles of humour but it feels appropriate and I am just happy to see these people fleshed out.Style
"The show looks amazing, the CGI is out of this world and the budget is definitely a big plus. When the action takes place, it is handled really well and in pretty brutal fashion. But the pacing of the show is a bit off, first the time jumps really don't help with getting us established with these characters and their actors. Also some of the episodes do feel a little slow at times with not much actually happening which is a shame.Overall"
"Overall, House of The Dragon Season 1 is a Great start for this new spinoff series. It continues good work from Game Of Thrones and with a few refinements it can live up to the epic heights.Rating - 8/10."
"This is way better than start of show comparing to original GOT 1st season. Amazing acting, very high budget, and you can see that in every second of this episode. I had high hopes and this was way better then i imagined it could be. Creators of Witcher tv show should see this, and learn from it."
"Lol so many salty GOT idolizers, I just had to say something: we're 4 episodes in, and y'all are acting like we've seen the whole show and can accurately compare. For those of you saying it's a soap opera, what do you think GOT and politics of monarchies in general are other than matchmaking and power struggle (with some zombies thrown in in the case of GOT of course)? 🤣 For those of you comparing actors, who in GOT was a good major actor beyond Dinklage?? Tywin with his cameos?? Waldau?? 🤣 Kit???!? 🤣 nod to Iwan Rheon as Ramsey Bolton.Excellent production. Story is slow-developing (just like GOT) as we continue to learn the characters and their place in the power struggle, so we'll have to see how it wraps up for a comprehensive evaluation of story and delivery quality. Plenty of action, and I like dragons a lot better than white-walkers. Yes, Paddy (the king) is not an imposing lead cast, but that seems to be the point they're trying to make! Rhys Ifans is his usual and decent creepy self as the Hand, Milly Allcock (young Rhaenyra) delivers a very impressive performance, while Matt Strong (Daemon) continues to do a fair job as a poor man's brooding rebel a-la James Dean (albeit without the emotional bravados that made Dean one of the greats).Settle down GOT fans...don't you wanna know what happens with all those swords from the throne room?!? 🤣"
"Season 1: 8 stars (2 viewings, 10/24/2022, 11/7/2022)After the horribly disappointing concluding chapter of Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon immediately throws us right back into that place we love. All of the technical aspects are up to par. They made the genius decision of using the same musical composer, beast Ramin Djawadi, as well as some of the original themes from Game of Thrones.The cast is great all around. There are a bunch of beautiful moments and impactful scenes. They do a really good job of engulfing you in a scene. For example, there will be an event or gathering, and you move around the event and hear different conversations without fully focusing on one. It feels like your experiencing the event rather than just watching a scene in a setting.I really enjoyed this season and can't wait for more."
"Yes it's gorgeous and yes its got wings, but not sure it has legs yet!The male leads are weak, Matt Smith hasn't yet sold his character, and the king very 2 dimensional, its nice to see the other houses and their names mentioned, but the series needs to add depth to the characters not just trade off the old familiar characters... we shall see! I hope it gets stronger."
"I loved G. R. R. Martin's Fire & Ice universe, and it's great to see the another of his work on screen set in that world. He is even listed as a creator on this series unlike Game of Thrones which eventually became nothing more than fan fiction near the end because Martin hasn't even completed it yet, and I'm not sure he ever will at this point. This story actually has a real ending he wrote which I hope to eventually see, which if you read Martin's history is actually quite tragic. I read Fire & Blood, which this is based on. It focuses on a legendary family feud among the nobles of House Targaryen that became known as The Dance of the Dragons, and while the Court intrigue and back stabbing is similar to Game of Thrones, it is smaller in scale and doesn't have as many factions or characters in the mix, unless it expands on Martins original story. It is an original and separate story unto itself, and as I loved this story when I read about it, I'm also enjoying watching it on TV and look forward to the epic dragon fights.The acting, script, direction, art, etc, is all above average, I have no complaints about it. It puts The Ring's of Power to shame in many ways which is other fantasy series I've been watching along with this one."
"It starts with a prologue: ""It is now the ninth year of King Viserys I Targaryen's reign"". ""172 years before the death of the Mad King, Aerys, and the birth of his daughter, Princess Daenerys Targaryen"" .It is said that the only two claims to succeed King Jaehaerys seriously considered at the Great Council of 101 were Rhaenys and Viserys. An intense epic concerning the internal succession war within House Targaryen at the height of its power, many years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. The Targaryen dynasty is at the absolute apex of its power, with more than 10 dragons under their yoke. Most empires crumble from such heights. In the case of the Targaryens, their slow fall begins when King Viserys (Paddy Considine) breaks with a century of tradition by naming his daughter Rhaenyra (Milly Alcock) heir to the Iron Throne. Viserys tells Rhaenyra that she must keep Aegon's secret just like every heir before her has done and he insists Rhaenyra must promise him that she will guard this secret. Rhaenrya is the third person to utter the iconic ""Dracarys"" line made famous by Daenerys (Game of thrones,2011), the second was Missandei and first was Daenerys herself. And Rhaenyra rides a yellow she-dragon named Syrax. But when Viserys later fathers a son, with the daughter (Emily Carey) of the king's hand, Ser Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) the court is shocked when Rhaenyra retains her status as his heir, and seeds of division sow friction across the realm, with intervention of ambicious aspirants to the throne as king's brother, Prince Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith) or Lord Corlys 'The Sea Snake' Velaryon (Steve Toussaint). At the beginning we see Gold Cloaks cutting the hands off of thieves at the command of Daemon.This is a spectacular epic dealing with friction nearly two hundred years before Game of Thrones (dealt with conflicts between the houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon and Targaryen and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn,Tyrell and Martell), now King Viserys of the House of Targaryen is the undisputed ruler of Westeros and surrounding lands, emerging a sucession dispute when the king names his daughter Rhaenyra as his heir; it sets in motion a series of events that many years in the future will lead to a bitter feud over who should sit on the Iron Throne. An impressive prequel dealing with inheritance disputes, court intrigues, treasons, in which political and sexual intrigue is pervasive ; all of them lead to full-scale war. Breathtaking epic version based on George R. R. Martin novels with exciting drama and overwhelming power fights, his stories are imaginatively brought to life on groundbreaking images with great production values and outstanding scenarios. To date, 18 episodes have been filmed. In the first episode Viserys hosts a tournament to celebrate the birth of his second child and Rhaenyra welcomes her Uncle Daemon back to the Red Keep. The title of the episode is directly taken from the chapter's title from the book ""Fire & Blood"", on which the show is based. Sword cross , intense drama, nudism , sexual scenes, great appearance of the giant dragons, and bloody fights abound in this spellbinding adaptation. Magnificent climatic battle scenes and struggles including lots of blood and gore ; and adding colorful computer generator images including the enormous firing dragons . The series is well written by an excellent plethora of screenwriters as Ryan J. Condal, Sara Hess, Fonseca, Kevin Lai , Ira Parker, Eileen Shim under supervision by the great creator George R. R. Martin. The series takes its name from the first novel in the book series ""A Game of Thrones"" - which is actually known as ""A Song of Ice and Fire"",and most of the show is largely faithful to the books . George R. R. Martin's story credit acknowledges the entire series under this title, rather than the title of individual volumes. Given that the series takes place almost 200 years before Juego de tronos (2011), the Dragon Pit , where the summit in The Dragon and the Wolf (2017) takes place, is not yet in ruins, but is instead one of King's Landing's major landmarks. George R. Martin was emotionally attached to the characters that he actually wrote and supervised the scripts. In Game of Thrones (2011) we see the City Watch, who are nicknamed ""Gold Cloaks"", in this series we see the origin of both the nickname and fashion choice. The music in the end credits is ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" by Ramin Djawadi, which is also the music from the closing credits of the series finale of ""Game of Thrones""."
"I gave some latitude to the early episodes being boring on the basis they were developing characters and the story but by episode 5 I have realised that it is just boring. There is no real intrigue, the characters are limited and the story is not exciting enough to hold any interest. I loved Matt smith as Doctor Who, one of my favourites after Tom Baker , at this stage I wish he would find a Tardis and escape from this dismal series. I have decided to avoid further episodes and do something more interesting like cut the grass in the garden . Perhaps I will hear there is something major in later episodes akin to a red wedding and excitedly return , but unfortunately I very much doubt it."
"It's inevitable that this series would be compared with GOT, and to some extent it doesn't disappoint. There's a host of intriguing characters and the CGI is adequate and broadly speaking it includes a lot of the aspects that made its predecessor entertaining.However, there are no real characters to root for with the possible exception of Rhaenyra and Lucerys (compare that to Bran, Arya, Jon Snow, Samwell etc in GOT) everyone in House of The Dragon seems to be villainous, although I've already taken sides on who I want to see win the battle for the throne.Also, the first series only focuses really on the goings-on in King's Landing, Dragonstone and Driftmark and the other kingdoms barely feature. Plus, the dragons and the CGI must have used up a lot if the budget, but do not compensate for character and plot. In addition, the existential threat from beyond the wall is alluded to, but we know in this series we're not going to face anything as catastrophic and frightening as the whitewalkers.Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to the next season and accept that series 1 was only setting the scene and that the real action and character development is to come and things will really kick off in the second series."
"There is so much to love here. You have some awesomely evil scheming characters like Larys and Otto, who are a blast to watch, as well as more chaotic characters like Daemon and Aemond. Every episode has something great in it, whether it is an epic battle, tense dramatic sequence, heartbreaking moment, or plot twist. The fact that the writers have done this well without having much book material to pull from is awesome. The dialogue is also great, with many memorable lines throughout. The fact that season 1 is just the prologue to this series is amazing.Yes, there are no purely good or evil characters like in GOT, and HOTD doesn't have the same amount of comedy. The time jumps in season one are annoying, but were only meant to set up the story. These criticisms are true but don't outweigh the great writing and production of this show.HOTD will not be game of thrones, and that's okay. It has more morally grey characters, lots of politicking, and superb writing. The characters are interesting too, but at this point in the show it's unclear who to root for."
"It is not GoT, and I still miss the deceiving and political plots we saw just in a few episodes of GoT. However, the story shed a light upon the history of the Targaryens, something that We just heard or saw in memories, personally I get to understand why the male Targaryens end up all crazy. It feels a bit like a soup opera, two ladies confronted, because one lied to the other about being a Virgin and all that it brings to those involved.Of course, we have Dragons, and a civil war; hopefully this family feud will give us memorable events. And this first season can lift the expectations for the upcoming story."
"First of all, the people crying ""woke-ism"" ? Please get over yourself and politics. Go Cry about having a diverse cast some where else like a MAGA rally.Now the actual review.After reading the book, so excited to have George RR on the project overseeing the show. This is an awesome time for Westeros. Like how they came out of the gates swinging. Hopefully they can develop the Targaryen's storyline and go strong with it. High hopes and excited."
"In fact, a good start, and they did not neglect to keep up with the novel, but I see some people want it down. These people are jelous of the appearance of other works derived from the world of Game of Thrones. I think they are lovers of the Breaking Bad series."
"This happens so often when a sequel or prequel gets made after a highly successful show has made its mark...Once that benchmark is set, it can be a tough if not Impossible act to follow... Such is the case here..There Are exceptions to this rule such as the Battlestar Galactica remake of the old original series wherein the successor Exceeded the original in every metric.. So it happens, but not here with GOT...Right off the bat, the initial opening scenes with the dragon and the young girl who is I guess, this shows version of Daneerys, All these scenes show a CGI that is severely lacking compared to GOT...The color palete looks faded, lacking detail and really, it looks like a computer rendered background that would not fool anyone... yes of coursre, it IS computer rendered but a good CGI will Not draw attention to that fact..It will Make you Believe... Not so here......The Dragon in the opening scene looks Wayy off which is wild since the original GOT had dragons rendered with cinema quality appearance of the highest order...Quite frankly, these dragons here look pathetic, lacking detail, menace, or sheer presence...its absent.... Being that there are 10 dragons in this show, maybe this is the runt of the litter but they Should have done Better.. As for the acting,initially I was offput by the casting and as many commented, I didnt feel an immediate connection with anyone here...Upon wading thru the 1st half of the show, I Will say that elements of the original GOT's vibe and atmosphere Are there and Do infuse some of the scenes , especially those with the young princess and her father and the dialogues of the father and Damon...Its not totally absent ,it IS there but in the format of a lighter budget show with lower caliber actors and effects and sets...Its Not so bad that you Cant get into it and I'd suggest suspending the sure to come judgements till you are a few shows into the series...Theres hardly any new series that doesnt need a few shows under its belt to hit its stride and hook in the viewers... most new casting feels stiff and wooden as actors are just getting Into their roles and have yet to inhabit them to the point of being Convincing...Yes, this show too is doing the wokeness theme and politically correct diversity dance as is just about Everything these days.. it is what it is and its part of the new world consciousness, it infuses Everything ...it can seem too ""forced"" and not a natural expression of the storylines when writers and casting try to conform to and make the story fit these current trends... that said, if you loved GOT, which i do , then certainly this is worth a watch to see how it evolves...why complain when a favorite series is given further expression? Enjoy it for what it is and those who do not want to see it, turn on Something Else...Simple as that!"
"Still being severely traumatised by the debacle of the finale of Game of Thrones I wasn't sure I wanted to even try the first episode of this new series. Of course I'm really glad I did! Although the series is still in its infancy, it is really promising and brings back the emotions of the original series of which it is a prequel. Not only that, it is also able to sublimate the source from which it is taken.Kudos must be paid to everything in it, from the script to the set construction, costumes and direction. The actors are all incredible, starting with Paddy Considine, who was a wonderful discovery. The characters of Daemon (Matt Smith) and Alicent (Emily Carey) are also fantastic. Milly Alcock is also very good in her central role.Right from the start, the series managed to bring us back into the world of Westeros, taking advantage of all the strengths of the original series. I'm grateful that they made it and I can't wait to see how it continues."
"I'm a big fan of both the Game of Thrones TV series & the novels.I feel like a lot of what made Game of Thrones great is missing from House of the Dragon.What I wanted from House of the Dragon was a good story with plenty of dragons, battles, funny characters (like Tyrion, Bronn & Jamie), devious plots & regular helpings of naked women. Is that too much to ask?What I got was a show where the writers seem as obsessed with showing us a recurring theme of gratuitus scenes of miscarriage (including a dead baby at one point!) Neither I, nor my girlfriend, want to watch a show with scenes like that in it. If that's what I wanted I would have sat down to watch a gritty hospital drama not a fantasy show about dragons. I get it. Miscarriages happen. But do we really need to focus on it in such grisly detail? Do we need it to be such a central theme to the show? I think not.And the constant skipping of several years & changing of actors/actresses was very annoying. Just when you're starting to get into it, you feel like you have to start all over again.I also feel like they failed to make the audience connect with some of the characters. When Lucerys was killed, I didn't care because he was such a minor character in the show. Such a wasted opportunity.I feel like they've stripped out some of the things that made Games of Thrones a classic and replaced it with things that were worse, which is a shame because I really think it has the potential to be a great show."
"The original GOT, right off the bat you're introduced to memorable and intriguing characters like Tyrion Lannister, Little Finger, Varys, Lord Stannis, Tywin, Cersei and Jaime, Robert Baratheon, Prince Geoffrey, and on and on. House of Dragons is another bland woke/feminist trope. The storyline is stale and you can easily guess what's coming next. There's no humor like Tyrion and Theon Greyjoy provided in GOT. There are no real backstories to any of the main characters. House of Dragon does not show what life is like for any of the other 7 kingdoms outside of King's Landing and it does a poor job at that as well. The entire premise of the show is to show how women were ""held back"" and ""oppressed"" and why the rebellion of the modern woman is justified. That's it and that's all. A very unclever brainwashing. There's nothing deep or creative about it. It's living off the previous GOT hype."
"Great show so far, the dialogue is sometimes excellent, but at other times suffers from ""laying it on WAY too thick"", and at points sounds like a smart 8th grader is writing it. Less is more with this show. Often when there is dialogue, the point is made in the first half of the conversation, and the last half is boring filler. Hopefully this gets better because everything else is just as good as the original, if not better! The landscape, dragons, characters, and more are all awesome! The show is visually stunning and if you've read the books (or not), you know this is a truly great story! Enjoy!"
"House of the dragonHouse of the Dragon is a series explaining one of the most powerful houses in the Game of Thrones series.The series explains events two hundred years before the series Game of Thrones.It is a mediaval series, from the time of the middle ages and with mythical parts.The series depicts the seven kingdoms with a common king, and in this house the king is of the house targaryen and at times there is only one female heiress and this causes some confusion.In my opinion, the series is good, it conveys a different reality, that is, from the old days and that was all based on interests, a different reality."
"Wow superb series if you like fantasy, action, schandals and a bit of romance. The older version of two female main actors were better at acting, but overall everyone did great at performing their characters. The storyline is superb, I was captuvated at every episode from beginning to end. I still have to watch Game of Thrones but this series ""House of the Dragon"" is top notch. This is a must watch if you like this kind of genre. This series is for adults as it sometimes gets very violent, rough and explicit 18+. I hope the series wins awards and I hope they will make a season 2. Rating: 9/10 yes it's very good 👍🏻 Go watch it now on HBO!"
This is actually much better then some seasons of the flagship series...because it's more connected and fluid.The acting is superb...i binge watched the entire series.HBO needs to invest into more of these shows but stop taking years in between seasons.I do wonder how long the show will last and stay this consistent.And what African American in a lead role makes me feel even more connected to the series and the story because it makes me think of what history could have looked like.Was never a huge fantasy person but after watching this I dare to dream.So hats off to HBO...the writing team...the actors.
"First episode was really impressive. The acting didnt disappoint and the set pieces, wardrobe all brought us back to good old Westeros. And I mean, we have dragons again, this is awesome. I hope they keep it up and it just gets better as we go along."
"It is a slow start, but my god it is going to be worth the long wait towards the ending of the first season! And whilst we're at it, I'm so glad I got to see what the previous generations were like and what they have done to each other, the seven kingdoms, and to the iron throne. The conversations may seem a little boring and long and at times it may seem like it leads to nowhere, but if you pay close attention you'll grow quite fond of their stories because you'll see that it is all going to make sense eventually! The gore is there, the spilling of blood, the practical fx, the cgi looks great, the fire, the dragons, the castles, this entire world looks amazing. The characters are very well written, the acting it is showing you just wanna punch some of them in the face at times, which is what makes a good actor great at his/her job, the plot is exceptional and it really pays to see what's happening towards the end. ""The ending"" had made me so mad and so hyped at the same time for what's about to come for the future of this series, which is something really really awesome. I can't get mad at this series but - to get a feel for it or a touch of pleasure - as prince Daemon would say, and guess what? I'm in love with it. I wouldn't have said that at first but I gave it a chance and now I'm already blown away. I'm so hyped for the beginning of season 2 cuz it is going to BLOW YOUR F. MIND!The winter is coming!!! That's all I'm gonna say..."
"GOT had fascinating characters and actors who portrayed them. I'm just not finding any in this new iteration of GOT with House of the Dragon. So, it really hurts the show. Plus the characters are all over the place. In one episode they are evil, in another they are good. The writing keeps contracting itself. Maybe they're trying to create complex characters and falling flat on their faces with the execution. I don't know? Also, if you can name more than five characters in this series after the first Season I congratulate you, because they were not that memorable to me, which is unfortunate.The first season is really a soap opera about two women growing up, and the children they bear. There's only one linear story, and no plot twists that you weren't expecting. The political intrigue that was so fascinating in GOT is here, but it's taken down a lot, to feel like it's ""watered down"".Now, they do copy the look of GOT really well, and it feels like GOT, so they get props for that. But, that's not enough to raise this above an average show. Also, with the ending of the final episode it does give hope that maybe Season 2, might be more exciting. So, there might be hope. Btw, I'm amazed at all the great reviews. It's like we were watching different shows? Or maybe we are just so desperate for more GOT we are more forgiving of it's faults. I for one, was not. Still, it wasn't a disaster, just not that good. 6/10."
"The characters are engaging and plausible, but haven't had a chance to develop yet, obviously. I'm looking forward to the next episode, and it does feel good to be back in Westeros.As for all the reviews complaining about ""Woke"" culture - really they're complaining about Black people in Westeros. C'mon.... If you can believe in dragons, surely you can believe in varying skin color? I sometimes think these whiners have no imaginations at all."
"So far house of the dragon is pretty good. It looks fantastic(these dragons omg), the acting is good, the dialogue is good and the plot is decent. But, if you compare it with the early seasons of Game of Thrones, it's just leagues below it in my opinion, and I will try to explain why. (Sidenote: When I refer to GOT, I am just talking about Season 1-4).One of my main complaints is, that everything just feels a bit too heavy. The music is always dramatic, every scene feels like it wants to be very important. And that's why the scenes where it would be important to feel this heaviness, just don't hit that much. And every good show has a bit of humor in it, even if it's subtle, but that just lacks here. This isn't an emotional rollercoaster, it's just one flat line of heavy scenes.The characters are just fine, not nearly as strong as in GOT. Otto Hightower is just not nearly as good as Tywin Lannister or Littlefinger. Viserys is the most interesting and fresh character so far in my opinion. Daemon is a bit overrated I think, not bad tho.My probably biggest complaint is, that the Plot is a bit too ""simple"" (until now) in my opinion. The plotting is not nearly as subtle and intriguing as in GOT. The war in the stepstones for example really had no depth at all. But we will see, I guess the plot will get more interesting soon, GRRM is involved.I'm also not a big fan of the time jumps, it's just a bit too much, and gives off a bit of a history documentary vibe. This is fine, but it can't compare to a really good-flowing story(like GOT).My last complaint is, that everything just looks(and feels) a bit too polished. I can't put my finger on what it is exactly. It just doesn't feel medieval, and it looks ""like a tv show"" to me, somehow a bit unrealistic, I can't really dive into the world that much.Also (without any spoilers), the end of Episode 3 was a bit worrying, the last sequence had some pretty stupid plotholes and didn't make much sense.But let's see where it goes! For now, it's a 7.5/10 for me, but I bet it will either go up or down significantly from here. But I'm sure it won't ever be as good as S1-S4 of GOT. And this is ok and makes sense. The story of GOT is basically GRRM life's work. The story of HOT D is just a tiny part of the (obviously amazing) backstory for the main story. If it would be a better story than the main one, it would just be weird haha.So if you are watching mainly for the plot and the characters, it won't ever beat early-GOT. If you're watching mainly for the vibe, the action and crazy dragons, it could even beat GOT for you!"
"So your'e telling me that 3 seasons of characterbuilding involving Robb Stark, Catelyn Stark, Robbs wife and their tragic deaths at the hand of Walder Frey in Rains of Castamere deserves the same rating and comparising as ""light our way"" in HOD? Im really trying to find out if this is real or just trolling...Over the course of 45 minutes ( episode-time) Criston Cole has a ons with Rhanerys, which evolves into some small soap-opera jealousy, and eventually results in Cole killing a gay dude we have seen for about 2 minutes in the series. So SHOCKING. Well, maybe Coles in for some Joffrey-treatment since he disgraced a royal wedding? Nah. He was sent out in the garden for some thinking time.. Seriously?Rains of castamere vibes? You got to be kidding me.."
"The spirit of GOT as usual, more suspenseful than the very first episode of GOT. If every episode turns out like the first then we are looking at 10 very good movies."
"I loved Game of Thrones but hate the way the end of the series was rushed. We NEEDED another season. The writing suffered greatly without George RR Martin, who was busy working on House of the Dragon. While the former faltered, House of the Dragon (HOTD) has flourished. I was skeptical during the first episode but started to believe in the series by the second. I was totally hooked by episode 3. Even with the time jumps and actress changes, the show does a great job leading us through all the sub-plots and additional characters. You never get lost. Shows like the Witcher... not so much in comparison. The Witcher's timeline was so confusing, I almost gave up after episode 2. Even if you've read HOTD's source material, Fire & Blood, you will be pleasantly surprised. The writing makes the show, the costumes are beautiful, and the casting is masterful. It puts the icing on the cake. Paddy is the stand-out here. WOW. He blew me AWAY. I will remember his tragic and haunting portrayal of Viserys (sp) as one of the Great Kings of Westeros... and Hollywood. Forget how GOT ended. Believe the Hype. It's very, very good. Let's hope season 2 continues the trend. A++"
"HBO and G. R. R. M.'s world returns in full force with the high quality writing, complex characters, amazing production value and political intrigue that we all fell in love with during GoT."
I accept this apology for the way GoT ended. So happy to see this on screen and am hopeful for how this will go! Interesting plot and characters. Great nods to people and places we are familiar with.
This episode is one of the best and greatest episodes. I hope that the episode will not end. I hope that the days will pass until we watch the next episode because the enthusiasm is strong.
"What a start! A solid episode! The hype was real.It proved how many goosebumps can be delivered in one hour episode. Showing the rise and fall of a character within an episode is no small feat. Extreme brutality with perfect BGM and cinematography. Dark, brutal, and spine-chilling from the very start. Ah! Peace of eyes!HBO nailed it again."
"Short review - it's obvious there wasn't the same sort of budget for this spin-off, and it does show a little in the production value - the dragons and scenery look like they were done on the cheap, but they're still passable.The cast is reasonable, but they seem hamstrung by a slightly poor script.. they come across a little bit like people pretending to be their favourite characters on GoT. There's none of the clever conversation that we were used to.I was going to complain about the lack of grittiness, but then remembered this is a period when all was good in the Seven Kingdoms (initially), so it's understandable that things would actually be quite nice and not so caked in mud!So not much more to say beyond that really - it'll be better to judge properly after all ten episodes have aired. If anyone is saying this is the best/worst thing ever, ignore them - it's impossible to know until we've had the first season, so approach with an open mind."
"Two episodes in and I'm so happy. This is going to be epic. I've already forgiven hbo for the final season of Game of Thrones just after the first two episodes of House of the Dragon. Great start, character development, storytelling and already some shocking scenes. I am very confident this will be one hell of a season and now we get the news season two is already greenlit. Sundays are great again. Thank you hbo for giving us this magnificent prequel. Beautiful sets, costumes and familiar settings and the GoT music is back! I got chills when episode two began with the GoT theme song opening. This is what top notch television is all about and HBO is the best in the business at creating original high quality shows."
"The sets, costumes, CGI are all first class like Game of Thrones. The plot(s) and dialogue are much more reminiscent of high class soap opera Downton Abbey.GOT revolved around a great mix of palace intrigue but more so traveling duos that would culminate in a 'meet up' and often a battle or deaths of some sort to resolve plot points. Characters grew by overcoming challenges both physical and intellectual. We saw Arya grow up from a little girl to an adult before our eyes, all while played by the same actress.In HotD what we get instead is strictly palace intrigue and a more soapy version of it endlessly revolving around who's sleeping with who and relentless child birth scenes (two in episode 6 alone). The traveling adventures are non-existent, and instead of seeing characters grow up we get massive time jumps that necessitate an entire recasting of the characters. Challenges include surviving childbirth, rare diseases and arson.It still has its appeal and the cast does a fine job with what they're given to work with, but I'm nowhere near that feeling of ""I can't wait for Sunday night"" that I had with GOT, in which 60 minutes would fly by and feel like 15. Now I watch maybe a couple days later on HBO Max when I have the time, and I find myself continually thinking about whether the HBOM subscription is worth it just for this.I hope they can pull away from 'Downton Incest' and move toward some of the things that made GOT (seasons 1-6) great. Otherwise this is feeling like just another show."
"A very limited single storyline. It kept on being dull missing the intrigues and broad different storylines that GoT had. I was hopefull in episode 5 and episode 6 just broke it. Let's just replace almost the complete cast mid season so that people certainly wont bond with the show and limit the story even more. The story gets even (more) predictable from there on.I just don't get the fuss around this show. I like the atmosphere, I like Matt Smith but I'm getting the feeling that I'm watching a soap opera rather than a game of thrones spinoff. Even the ""war"" is fought almost entirely off screen."
"As good as game of thrones.If you like Game of thrones, you'll be happy with House of Dragon. The only difference is the less explicit portrayal of sexuality, which is rather good for the series.You have to keep in mind that this is the first season of House of Dragon and the characters have to develop first. Still, the time jumps within the first season were a bit rough. You had just gotten used to the stars, and now you have to tick them off again. That wasn't so nice. But that's actually the only serious criticism. Let's hope that season 2 will bring more temporal peace.Anyway, I'm looking forward to the season finale."
"I was skeptical at first... not sure how they would be able to maintain the feel of GOT when doing something entirely different. They did. The directors found a way to tie the storyline and sprinkled some foreshadowing masterfully.The actors own their parts and the subtle details bring you into the House of the Dragons world.The music, photography, direction, costume design, EVERYTHING has surpassed my wildest expectations.Personally, I enjoyed the first two episodes of house of the dragon much more than LOTR's The Rings of Power. If you were on the fence about watching-do yourself a favor and just do. You won't regret it."
"Came in fresh off GoT with impossibly high expectations and I'm glad to admit HoTD met every single one of them. This is basically GoT with a bigger budget and I'm here for it. From the soundtracks, to the sweeping cinematic shots, everything is just so compelling.And let's not forget the casting, Milly Alcock and Matt Smith as Rhaenyra and Daemon are some of the best casting choices I've seen in a while now and it's so refreshing.The only gripe I have with the show so far is the reusing of the main theme from game of thrones as the main theme here. I really wish Ramin Djawadi had made a new original theme song for this that could have been as epic as GoT's opening theme but sadly not.Asides that it's been a great watch.Solid show. 10/10."
"I don't know why imdb allows full series reviews after only a pilot has been released as I deem it impossible to judge an entire show after having only watched an episode. Therefore i've watched the entirety of season 1 before sharing my thoughts on this long awaited prequel to GoT.Now let's face it; we live in an era of abundance when it comes to quality TV-series. I would say there are more watch-worthy shows out there than most of us would ever find the time to watch, in huge part because of the rise of streaming networks, all competing for our time & money. As a result of this ""good"" or even ""very good"" is simply not enough of a merit to warrant the time investment required to watch a show to completion.Why do i mention this? Initially i thought this show would fall into forementioned categories. And with initially i'm referring to pretty much the first half of this season. While i never found this prequel to perhaps the greatest series of all time (yeah, the ending sucked but it's an overall assessment) to be bad it simply didn't do a good job of capturing my interest at first. Yeah the acting, writing and directing was great at all times but the conflict itself seemed at first to be nothing more than a family drama about succession and gender roles instilled with the occassional action scene. Because of this i nearly gave up on this series...But as the title says; I'm glad i stuck with it. Now i was initially against the switching of actresses since i thought the OG ones were so stellar in their performances, but the new ones were equally as great and the transition went by almost unnoticed on my behalf. Not only that but we have also been introduced to a plathora of new characters, all interesting and sure to take the show in new and exciting directions by adding more altogheter possibilities to the story, making it almost as unpredictable as it's predecessor. We also have a clearer sense of where the show's heading now as opposed to at the start and in retrospect it made me appreciate the initial, slower, episodes more for making me care more about these characters, where they are heading and why.I'm not a fan of complexity for complexitys sake when it comes to storytelling but i really thought it worked when it came to GoT as despite the enourmous amount of characters they were all distinct, memorable and most importantly added a near infinite variables to how the story could end. Every death could drastically change the balance of power in favor for one party or the other and i think with the end of this season we're on the same page. As a non-book reader I'm happilly clueless as to where this show will take me and i'm equally as happy for how much i find myself caring for who'll take the throne at the end."
"House of the Dragon has good bones and a good foundation but the pacing is so slow it's hard to stay captivated unlike the expertly directed and edited first few seasons of Game of Thrones. What they achieved by moving between characters persecutors, giving you just king enough for something to breathe, and the development of story is not present here. The amount of dialogue and plot that could fill 40-45 minutes maximum is stretched to 55-60 and it feels like a slog. If HOTD had better editing and pacing, it might be more successful at keeping your attention while simultaneously raising stakes."
"This first season took on a lot of deep conflicts and themes and, to its credit, does pretty well with them. The themes of disregard for women, self interest vs care for family, love vs entitlement, love vs revenge characterize this season deeply. Many of the character arcs like Rhaenyra's or Alicent's or Viserys' are awesome.However, the execution feels far too often off-tune. The plot writing doesn't feel as airtight as early GoT and oftentimes has difficulty bridging character arcs, episodes, and even scenes to make a cohesive and intense experience.Two great examples of this come from the semifinale. We cut directly to Aemond saying he should be king before the shot transition is even completed, no lead up to the moment. We also see Rhaenys dance the same tired conversation of her being passed over for Queen rather than the tension she now faces at having to choose whether to honor her agreement with Rhaenyra and kill children from her own family, join Alicent and still kill children, or to let themselves rend the family apart without her involvement.I am overall grateful for this season and the nuggets of diamond it's given us, and the good qualities of the story as a whole, but I expect a higher caliber of storytelling from this franchise and I simply did not see it. So I take off 2 for the major problems in execution."
"Update ***After watching the full series I have to give this an underwhelming 6 out if 10.There were some moments when I thought it was going to get interesting but after the passing of many years and a cast change it was just more of the same family bickering from unlikeable people.I think from about Ep6 i just started losing interest plus as I know how it all ends they made the journey rather dull.Update ***I like everyone else have only seen Ep1, it starts ok introducing some historical context. The problem with this introduction is it seems to have spelled out the entire story.Kings landing looks like GoT Kings Landing but more plastic, highly saturated colours which tend to be a result of Green Screen. Armour again looking plasticated, the Targaryen hair looked off as well.Aesthetically it doesnt look as real or gritty like GoT.The story so far was an introduction to the main characters but while looking at who is in play it kind of looks predictable.Obviously ill have to wait for a few more episodes to see how things develop but right now Im just not sure there is enough meat to the storyline.Another point to make is that here we follow one area of Westeros which is Kings Landing.In GoT in the first episode we got to see many different locations.Paddy Considine is a bit wasted as a broken man, his leadership appears weak. Matt Smith is interesting as his brother/antagonist.Rhys Ifans is fairly stiff throughout with not too much to do except to look a bit underhand and dodgy.The rest of the cast are fine the princess isnt bad but i know there is another actress playing an older version of her at some point ( not sure why ).It all feels like a GoT homage dressed up as a prequel, I hope they find somewhere interesting to take this rather than where it looks most likely to be heading.Can only wait and see...."
"It is such a dissapointment,the pace is slow the characters are boring. They are just trying to replicate Got but failed. There just be blood there should be nudity it is not a kid show the only good think to see in this show is the start crédit music which is also copied from thé original Got. And I dont understant the requirement of a prequal we already have an idea what will happen in the future it already have been told in Got. If they really want to make of Got then they should focus on after the event of season 8 it will be more intresting to watch other than this HoD is a pura dissapointment."
"Okay, so after 3 episodes. My honest opinion.Let's cut to the chase. If this wasn't linked to GOT, how many would still be watching it?It's slow, it's kinda boring and not a lot happens.I know GoT was like this at times, however I'm hoping this is the build up for what is set to come (having read the books).It'll always get compared against GoTs and at the moment, this feels bland and if this wasn't related, I'd most likely have given up.The crab feeder - how short was that battle? It sort of feels like the last season of GoT where they rushed through a lid of stuff as it felt needless to them. This adds character to people though. Can you imagine if we'd condensed the tragedy of Ned Stark into 3 episodes?"
"This work offered fantastic imagination, elaborate writing, and exquisite orchestration. The future of the House of the Dragon seems to be excellent. The most beautiful thing about House of the Dragon is to convey the events from a slightly different point of view from the book, while not abandoning the course of the story and reversing the correct point of view, although they need time jumps, but this did not affect the events of the series and the change of actors as it was not affected due to the choice of actors The two wonderful people, the music was very wonderful. Of course, it was from the legendary composer Ramin Jawadi, so he was a genius and had a special touch with the viewers. Everything was excellent in the series and complete. We rarely find complete works."
"The first time I heard about this show coming in, I was more than skeptical. Prequels are hard, and less than 10% can get them to be attractive. After finishing Better Call Saul (the best series prequel of all time!) I didn´t want to be disappointed by this.Nonetheless, yesterday I wanted to watch a movie, but I wasn´t sure if I had enough energy to be awake through a whole film. Failing to find a nice thriller, I thought ""what a heck, let´s try the pilot of HOTD"".Not only did I saw the first two episodes without getting sleep, but I was willing to watch another one.+ Good Production"
+ Great Plot
+ Good acting
+ Interesting characters
"+ It´s really for adultsThe feeling of ""adventure"" is lost because most of the time you are in King´s Landing.Mediocre CGI."
Well as expected it's incredible and let's see how it goes. Hoping fire continuese. The show is epic carectors looking promising and we know that the more carectors has to come. Let's see how it goes.
"What started for me as another 1.5x playing speed series in fantasy land, quickly turned to surprise, astonishment, praise, satisfaction and in some memorable episodes and scenes in awe.I was quite surprised by the tremendous level of acting, storyline plots and sub-plots, filming, cinematography, superbly fitting music, score and most visual effects / CGIs.What struck me the most was the vibe and sensations that I was getting when members of the ""families"" were present (in scenes), talking / playing mischievous deeds and brutal actions to each others; it was like I was among them, there in those rooms, in those halls, feeling what they were experiencing, being happiness, satisfaction, dread, frustration or anger; especially the last two feelings were the strongest and for that I only praise the cast. Kudos!After the finishing of episode 5 and the change of some of the actresses and cast in the next one, I was quite angry and dejected, cause those before were more beautiful and fitting to my eyes and memories, but the thought quickly changed and I came to like and even love the new characters of Queen(s) Rhaenyra and Alicent.My 1.5x playing speed changed throughout to 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.1 and stabilized to normal speed in the last episode. That was how intense the experience was, those last bloody scenes in the sky underneath and above the clouds and the then desperate spark of ice-cold revenge in Rhaenyra's eyes that blew me away..."
"Superb, ground-breaking and a fine complementing prequel to the stellar GoT. Cannot wait for season 2!Screenplay/story: 8.5Development: 9.4Realism: 9Entertainment: 9Acting: 9Filming/cinematography: 9.4VFX: 9Music/score: 9.5Depth: 8.5Logic: 7.5Flow: 9Action/adventure/drama/fantasy/romance: 9Ending: 9.2."
First: just like GOT this series don't have perfectly good person or perfectly bad person and all of its characters are gray
Second: just like GOT the main issue is ironthrone and heir
Third :it's screen play is much better than episode1 of GOT
and lastly some of the house of dragon's casts are more charming to me than GOT (for now )
"The casting of this show is real odd. Some were great (Paddy Considine, Matt Smith, Rhys Ifans, Olivia Cooke in particular), but others are really weird and just don't look or feel right.. and as the characters age, they're replaced with actors that don't flow well, it's quite odd, confusing and a shame.GOT was a big boot to attempt to fill and working from mainly the books would have helped it enormously, so the writers of this have done a reasonable job.Shame that there weren't more connections to the story arch of the main original books, as that could have been really interesting and given it more depth.Overall this is more than watchable and I enjoyed big chunks, it's just poorly shaped and corners have been cut."
I love how the show does what this universe does best and doesn't seem to care for any political correctness or the like. It's a gritty world and the show reflects that.
"We have to compare it at the end with GOT as it's part of the story after all but with less interesting plot, the whole plot can be reduced to 2 short episodes not long 10!, the acting was good and great picture and directing, with a better plot and the absence of GOT the rating could be better, as usual the sound track was amazing, great set design and architecture, wished to see the history of other houses as well I know it's about Targaryens but they mentioned other houses briefly which gave the sense of a low budget (we couldn't afford to shoot in other locations..worth watching but for me it was a little boring and very slow paced."
"Game of Thrones opened up with elements of shock and horror. It's diverse plot lines and strong actors instantly got you invested in the characters and wondering about the world they live in.Prequel of thrones on the otherhand just opened with the same lore that we already knew but added little to no story. There's no redeeming feature in any of the characters. There's no shock, no elements of horror or impending doom.Ill give it another episode, but if it doesn't introduce at least half a dozen worth while characters to care about then what's the point?P. S. Why do they all look like they are deep fakes, can't they put a wig on properly?"
"From the first episode you just know that there's a lot to come before the end. If the 13 dragons said to be making an appearance didn't give you reason to anticipate then maybe seeing Viserys and his court bicker or Daemon blatantly disregarding the crown should. Seriously there's no one on Viserys court that is trustworthy and the king well, he has so far proved to be a fool. Seems to be a recurring theme, first Robert Baratheon on Got and now Viserys Targaryen. Daemon and Rhaenyra absolutely steal the show and Emily D'Arcy hasn't even made an appearance yet. Daemon's rogue, arrogant, complicated, morally grey persona is fascinating and it'll be interesting watching him push for the crown. I like the fact that they went with smaller group of characters to focus on, focusing on a large group with no one main character worked well for game of thrones however they went a different direction on house of the dragon and it suits them.Stay tuned cause we haven't even seen dragons fight yet! And they're 13 on this show! 13!"
"This show is amazing, it deserves a 9+, but I am giving it a 10 to make up for all the bad reviews as much as I can.So many reviews are saying that it is too slow, too boring because it isn't so spread out like GoT with multiple different character strings, that it's too political, or that GoT had better CGI.And there is much more criticism, that only comes from individuals though and most of it doesn't even make sense. I read one review that reviewed after the first episode, and among a few other things it said that there was no character development. In the first episode. That actually made me laugh, lmao.But all of this isn't really justified. It might be a little slow, but in a very good way. I would have liked it if it was even a little slower, I think they could have also made season one with just the first cast, and then have the big time jump(s) to the start of season 2, or a little later in season 1.It definitely isn't boring at all. Yes, it isn't as spread out as GoT was and it is more focused on the politics, but that doesn't really make it any worse. The quality of this show is still amazing, just like GoT. I'm not sure how people can disagree here, but I really think the acting is amazing, the dialogue, the music, the visuals, really everything is great.I'm not sure about the CGI, maybe GoT's was better, but if so I don't remember it to be much better. There is nothing wrong with HotD's CGI, nothing seemed bad, unrealistic or not fitting."
"I like thousands of others were hooked into Game of Thrones as the best television series of all time. However bad writing definitely prevented this from being true.Ryan and Miguel have worked incredibly close with George to bring this as faithful as possible adaption and it shows! The pacing has been perfect, the casting - perfect. The writing - amazing. This show even adds to the book lore and both mediums complete one another. I actually wish I hadn't read Fire and Blood so I could go into this show completely blind - but that doesn't take away from how much I am enjoying this series.I cannot wait to get tucked into the rest of this series and I hope this quality carries through."
"We aren't in Westeros anymore. Court Intrigue, spymasters and daring swordplay take a backseat in favor of his unfalteringly spineless majesty's efforts to allow his daughter to live out her power fantasy of having whatever she wants damned the consequences to the line and legacy. What I like, or rather used to like, about these stories was just how unpredictable everything was. How suspenseful it was when literally no one was safe. Now people run around with plot armor who can literally withstand armies being thrown at them. This show has done everything it can to make me dislike it, though alas I'm sure many people will view this as a refreshing departure from its brutal counterpart."
"Pun intended. Like others I wanted to dislike this but just can't. It's wonderfully acted, and has that vibe of the original that draws you in. A new story and new characters to love and hate while giving you a sense of familiarity like you've been there before.I don't really have any complaints that I can think of. It's slow moving for the most part and that appears intentional.. as the twists and turns keep you from getting bored and keep you intrigued because you wonder where they are going with all this. The writing isn't sloppy it's quite well done from what I've seen thru to episode 4. All I can say is I am in for the ride and already invested into several characters."
Expected this to be awful but surprised by how good it is. But knowing they are recasting the best character 6 episodes in is a huge put off for me as I feel it's just going to ruin the show and these time jumps are so rushed. They should be following the style of for All mankind's time jumps that has covered 30+ years in 3 seasons and made sense but so far in 3 episodes of house of dragons the kings kid and wife have died and now he's got married and now has a 2 year old son in 3 episodes! This season already feels rushed.It's still a fantastic seasons atm but I feel once they get recast your going to have to get to know a new character and if they are cast badly which I feel it is as I'm not a fan of anything the new renaria (however you spell her nane) actress has been in and she's replacing my favorite character so will be make or breakI just feel I've missed episodes or not paid attention as so much has happened story wise and only been 3 episodes and 3time jumps.
"This is the perspective of someone who hasn't read the books and isn't a fanatic of GOT. I think this series was great! I was excited to watch HOD every Sunday afternoon with my wife. It's the first season, so there's a lot of time jumps to get to the center of the story, which is the dance of the dragons. First season is mostly going through a quick summary and timeline of what leads to the split in the kingdom. I enjoy the green queens acting a lot (the older version). I feel that if they don't drop the ball like they did with the last season of GOT, it will be up there in best shows of all time."
"Remember those (very few) episodes of GoT that felt like filler? Well, 80% of the first season of House of Dragon feels like that. The first 5 or 6 episodes are very slow paced and could easily have been squeezed into an episode or two.None of the deaths feel particularly sad as we barely get anytime with the characters so don't really care when they die. The decisions of many characters were often illogical and reminiscent of the later stages of GoT.The acting is pretty average, nothing special.Should you watch this? Unless you are super interested in the targaryens I'd hold fire until another few seasons are released. On the plus, the finale was a little interesting and season two will certainly be better than season one.There won't be another show like GoT anytime soon, and this wasn't even close."
"I have to say I am very happy of how the series is done and the way the story telling is done. It is GoT in every aspect, and even better at some as lessons were learned. So good. Sadly they dont release the whose season upright so I can enjoy it immediately .Watch it you will not be dissapointed.Characters were done superbly, there are no flawn in the acting and everthing is believable in a way they act and respond to the conversations. Everything looks amazing as well when CGI is concerned. Perfect plend. Dont know what anyone could as for.Ah yes RTS game in the universe of Westeros woul be great for us games so we can take control of our favourite houses :)"
***** Update after the 4th episode:
It is waste of time.***** The comment below is made after the first three episodes. *****House of the Dragon is built upon the success of Got but it doesn't resemble GoT in terms of the viewer experience. There is some action going on but it doesn't engage the viewers probably because the characters are sort of dull and the text has not shown any promise to be interesting so far. Not to mention GoT was successful but overall quality of the show is also debatable.It feels to me like the remakes of old successful movies that don't match the original. It is quite common these last couple of years. Some of them even feel like an insult to the original. Unfortunately it is still profitable.It has not been engrossing like GoT so far but it is not so bad either. It can go either way in the future episodes. It can turn out to be a complete waste of time or we might be watching an amazing show.
"The first few episodes were entertaining and I thought the plot setup was reasonably good, but after that things don't really change and it is the same stuff over and over again.The character's seem to remain the same throughout the story, they simply get older. I was kind of hoping something interesting would happen with the characters to make the story worth telling. I only got through episode 8, but based on what I saw I could've stopped at episode 3 and essentially had a complete understanding of all the main characters.I was mainly hoping Rhaenyra would start to grow up and become someone worth rooting for, instead it is the same old ""I'm upset people want a King not a Queen, I deserve the throne, my life is so bad"". While Rhaenyra is off in her delusional self-pity fest, her father is committed to giving her the throne despite seemingly no good reasons to do so. She has never done anything to ""deserve"" the throne because she was simply born into a potential claim to it, and she lives a life of luxury where her father practically gives her all that she wants. (though he wants her to marry someone in accordance with how royalty does marriage, I guess that is the one problem in her life) I can't really empathize with a spoiled brat like her, I don't see why anyone would want to. Rhaenyra seems to be nothing more than a stereotypical member of royalty who only cares about herself and her own power.Some other reviews compare this show to a soap opera, that seems pretty accurate to me. There are surprisingly few stakes or consequences for the main characters of the show, and each episode has almost nothing happen except continuing to show the continuing ""drama"" which is about as tense as ""ooooo, Rhaenyra and this other lady are super mad at each other, look how mad they are!"".Small final note, I found it very odd how the show is so obsessed with birthing scenes. I can understand the one in the first episode, but it seemed really weird how many there were after that, and long and pronounced those scenes were. Is this a soap opera thing? Do people want to watch this? I understand the family lines are important to the show, but I am not personally interested in watching live birth portrayals regularly."
"This program is off to a tremendous start, if you liked GoT then you're going to like this. I just hope the tempo stays the course. Please let there be giants in this one also, I'd love to know their back story. Can't wait to see who's the protectors on the wall this time also. So many directions this can go in. It really doesn't get much better than this I look forward to Sunday evenings again for sure. Don't know why a review has to be 600 characters I think that's a bit ridiculous. I am now just typing words because I have run out of things to say. Well I'm going to go to bed now, and count sheep. I guess I still have to write more and more words for this review. This is absurd I tell you when."
"This is a show for both new viewers and those who watched GoT. The politics are back. The drama is back. The characters are grounded and layered. This show comes in with GRRM's oversight clearly felt in the writing. The acting, direction and music are also fantastic. It will be a crime if Paddy Considine does not get an Emmy nomination for his role as King Viserys. Like the first seasons of GoT it's obvious that time, thought and effort has been put into crafting a good story. You will be spending a lot of time intimately with a cast of complex characters; the first season is obviously mostly here to set up the characters, but it manages this without being boring or stale, because the characters are interesting and the story is gripping. This first season stands on its own and is nothing short of an achievement for the franchise, especially in the aftermath of the final seasons of GoT. And I can't wait to see where it goes from here."
"The show is more a 8 tan a 10, but I am giving it a 10 because the people who give It a 1. Crying over something as logical as a recast doesn't make any sense, so I have to strike a balance. It is a practically anthological series that tells us about the LIFE of Rhaenyra Targaryen, so it is logical that the chapters have jumps of years between each other and even that they change the actress. Using nonsense arguments like ""attachment to the first actress"" is being very immature. The series does a great exposition of the Targaryen family at that time and is pretty faithful to the books, except for some minor details that are not really important.Looking forward to the second season, which all readers know is coming."
"I can't quite understand why some of the reviews here are lower than a 7, maybe because of how bad the final season of GoT was.Either way, House of the Dragon is absolutely captivating. The writing is phenomenal, and you feel attached to every character in a way that has you invested in their own personal stakes.The dragons are stunning, and the CGI is far better than the Dragons in GoT.I haven't had that anxious excited feeling each week impatiently waiting for a new episode of a show in a long time.This may turn out to be as good, if not better than the first 7 seasons of GoT. Easily one of the best shows out there, and it's just getting started."
"I'm not gonna talk about the good vs bad in this TV series, nor will I talk about what I liked & disliked in it, because anyone who watched Game of Thrones would know what to expect here (it's a continuation in the form of a prequel) ... however I'm only gonna say that even though I was hesitant about loving it after watching each episode, my sentiment turned into an overwhelming adoration for it after watching the finale of the first season (and in particular: the last 2 scenes) ... It steamed up the occasional somewhat stale drama & somewhat slow pace into a storm of dragon fire, and made me absolutely sure that the next coming seasons will be exceptional & glorious in all their details."
"Waited for the entire first season to air to rate and was surprised as the show exceeded all of my expectations. House of the Dragin Brings back the incredible type of programming that the first six seasons of the original Game of Thrones brought us. As I whole I found the show absolutely amazing, and this is the first show since the original to recapture that magic since. No one is safe, everyone justifies their actions and you get to choose who your personal heros and villains are. So many amazing characters that you love or hate, not paintings of backgrounds, but real believable gritty scenes from castle to terrible dragons abound."
"It was fine, but I won't make time in my schedule for it. I might watch the rest of this some day, but not anytime soon. I don't think hbo will recoup on this investment."
"It's a great start for a prequel , the time jumps are really good and the acting was incredible specially Paddy Considine (king Viserys ) he definitely deserves an Emmy nomination.The CGI was good but Game Of Thrones was the best specially the dragons.However the first season was really awesome and a good start I'm so excited for the next seasons.The make up was amazing mainly in the episode 8 .The only problem was that some characters didn't get older than the other Like OTTO HIGHTOWER and DAEMON it was it's been more than 20 years and they still the same like in the first episode , I hope they will notice that in the season 2."
"I personally am not a fan of this genre. Yes, I like content that focusses on medieval life. But this show is too much focussed on who is to marry who. And if an existing husband is a blocking factor, well... he just then all of a sudden dies. Regularly in suspicous circumstances.What it is also about, is the constant birth of babies. And too often the births go hand-in-hand with major issues, causing either the mother or the baby to die during birth.I think therefore that this show has many similarities with soap operas. Only in this case with a huge production budget and good actors. Much of the shallow, soap opera-like storyline is compensated for by the truely great visual experience. The castles, the surroundings, the dragons, ... they are all top notch.I think therefore that a great opportunity is lost by not having a better storyline. For instance, they could have put more war-like situations in it. What is also a missed opportunity in the current show, is that they failed to develop the character and personality of all children. As a viewer, you are totally left in the dark even on the different names of the children. And since those children become more important at the end of the show, it is in my opinion a failure that there wasn't more focus on those children in earlier episodes.What I was very impressed by, was the performance of the actor that played the role of the King. His acting performance in episode 8 - ""The Lord of the Tides"" - was of such an impressive level, that it deserves a special mention in this review.All-in-all, it was still an okay watch. I would rate it as 7.2/10. With a better storyline, this show could have easily scored way higher."
"I'm only giving it two stars because the dragons are fantastic! For a prequel, this is spectacularly way off the mark and sloppy! For a start, the young actors at the beginning of the the season, bear very little resemblance to the actors who take the characters through to the later episodes. This is a particular bug bear of mine and it's LAZY. REALLY LAZY. Who can forget the DREADFUL young Lily in Harry Potter? She looked nothing like Daniel Radcliffe and her eyes were brown, instead of blue! Bad casting. These film makes get paid a bundle, so to miss something SO fundamental is just a poor effort. INCREDIBLY POOR.I didn't think much of the storyline either, in fact I was quite shocked at how weak the narrative was. It seemed overly contrived and then badly executed. We had been given a few hints in GoT of what was to come, and it seemed so juicy. Warriors riding around on dragons, the Targaryens with their madness, incest and audacity. Should have been a winner. Not stodgy, not lost in the depths of some dusty history.And why do the internal scenes have to be filmed on some gloomy set? Was there a power shortage ?Had they no lighting rigs. Did they film in it using the torch app on the crew's phones? It's so bloody dark. Haven't the makers heard of LIGHTING. I know that the director is fond of dark murky looking filming, but get a grip, light your work so that it can be seen. We have a state of the art TV and even it had difficulty in making this watchable. I gave up trying to watch it on my tablet, and others that I have spoken to have had serious problems actually viewing it. What must it be like for anyone with eye sight problems? If a programme is not truly accessible, doesn't that make the programme makers disrespectful of their audience?And what is up with King's Landing? I know that this tale takes place a few generations before GoT, but the place that they've created has no likeness to the King's Landing of the Lannisters. I know that the maker's switched locations, but with the magic of filming, they could have created somewhere that looks like a historical recreation of King's Landing.I also think that some of actors were miscast, and as such , I don't think that they were truly credible in this series. There is a clear lack of chemistry between some of the leads who are meant to be romantically linked. Without chemistry, the whole endeavour falls apart. This is a serious concern, so much so that I probably won't watch anymore episodes of this series. That's a shame because it could have been so good, but this dark, badly written, lazily conceived piece of nonsense is just awful."
Awesome Series.I just love the HOD
It is very addictive and enjoy full.I was a fan or game of thrones
But after game of thrones nothing fullfill my appetite
For fantasy drama and season
I tried to watch other shows but no show has the match of GOT
And now HOD
I love all the episodes and story of the series
The effects are good the battles are good
And i love all the characters
I wish they dont spoil this show like GOT in the ending
Over all house of dragon is good show
And even have less adult scenes
So you can watch easily
I wish they also release a censored edition so we can watch with someone else.
"I mean, there's no reason to call this boring, it isn't much different from first episodes of GoT.Such big world, complex relations and character personalities always take a few introducion episodes so the viewers get deeper into plot.If you dont like the storyline, go watch action."
"As a longtime fan of the SOIAF book series and the history/lore (""Fire & Blood""/""World of Ice & Fire""), it's been so refreshing to see the world of the ""Dance of the Dragons"" events in the series' history come alive and in such a well-done way! The direction, writing/adaptation, acting, set/costume design - all brilliantly done. Being familiar with the events to come, I'm excited to see how they interpret it on the show. It was a no-brainer that they would use the ""Dance"" as material to keep the GoT HBO gravy train moving along, but I'm glad that they did. I loved the original source material and I'm already enjoying the adapation of said material very much!"
"The first episode is perfect! The central theme of this series is SUCCESSION and the issue of male primogeniture - and this is beautifully set up with the opening scene showing the Great Council in 101 AC. A short intro but important to understand why Rhaneyra being chosen as heir spells a dark shadow that will carry through the episodes to come.As a book reader, I was greatly surprised in a positive way by how the showrunners enriched the book either by adding extra stories or elaborating on one aspects which were not in the book.Great acting from all casts especially Matt Smith and Milly Alcock. Smith's performance brings many nuances to the complex Daemon Targaryen.Art direction, costumes, cinematography are great. This era is supposed to be the height of the Targaryen's power and one of the opening shots shows King's Landing from aerial view (dragon rider's POV) which I think is very effective and grand.Two dragons are shown in the first episode and even though i read some people complained about why they are different from the dragons in GoT - I think they are great. Each dragon is so distinctively different and has characters of its own. Mind you they said there will be 15 dragons and being able to distinguish one from another will be an enjoyable watching experience.Lastly, the music scores from the great Ramin Djawadi totally brings you back to Westeros."
"House of the Dragon is incredible. Not only is it one of the best shows I have ever seen, it may be one of the best things I have seen all year! I love the original Game of Thrones series, but this for me took it to a whole new level. The show is unbelievably good, and if you don't believe me, just go watch it for yourself. The writing is brilliant! It's intelligent, nuanced, and so intense! The show is mainly carried by character interactions and dialogue, and it was riveting! I have never seen dialogue scenes be as intense as thrilling as an action scene before... but here I would take an intense confrontation over a battle scene any day... the writing is just that good! The story they tell is quite interesting, and feels a lot more focused than Game of Thrones, as we are only following House Targaryen throughout this story. But don't worry, there is still a lot of drama and conflict to be had, and the way the characters are written lead to some great moments! Each character seems to be working for themselves and have their own strategies to make their play for the throne, which inevitably rips apart the family. I was so into all the family politics, succession debates, all the plotting for the throne - there were moments I wanted to scream in shock, cheer, and even cry! I loved seeing the broad story unfold over a number of years, and while the time jumps were jarring, they worked quite well for this story. The time jumps were also handled so well from a casting/acting standpoint, as the two casts are not only incredible, but perfectly match their older/younger counterparts. I LOVED Milly Alcock as a young Rhaenyra and Olivia Cooke was perfect as an older Allicent. Matt Smith was amazing as Daemon, Rhys Ifans was so good as Otto, but my absolute favourite actor/character in the show was Paddy Considine as King Viserys. I've loved Paddy ever since seeing him in Edgar Wright's films, but his performance here just elevated him as an actor in my eyes, and he deserves all the acclaim in the world for this performance, especially in the later episodes as his character's condition declined. While on that topic, the makeup and visual effects of this show... top notch! The dragons looked so real- and so threatening! The production value as a whole on this show is unparalleled, every element is done to perfection. Ryan Condal truly pulled together a masterpiece of a show, and I'm so glad George R. R. Martin was very involved this time around, as it really helps with the lore of Westeros! This show was such a return to form for Game of Thrones, and if you haven't seen the original show, this is the perfect place to start (I showed both my girlfriend and mom and they both fell in love with it)! I cannot recommend this enough, it is the best thing on TV right now, with some insane production values, stunning performances, and excellent writing! The show managed to pull off a seemingly perfect season- there was not one ""bad"" episode, instead each one just got better and better... and oh man did it even stick the landing! Somehow this show worked brilliantly! I LOVED this show, I cannot wait for season 2! God this show was incredible, for sure one of my favourite first season's of any show... just truly stunning!"
"Only the first four episodes are available at this time, but when the fourth one ended I had a big smile on my face. It's just so well written, and in the last few years I had forgotten what it's like to watch a show with this much depth, character, attention to detail, and proper pace. Things feel earned in this show.Is it perfect? No, but nothing is. I'm giving this such a high rating because of what it is measured against, and that is all the fantasy shows currently on television. I won't go into any of those other than to say that all of them are pretty good, but NONE of them have what this show has.So what does this show have?Let's start with characters with tremendous depth. You'll be thinking you found the villain, and about what a cruel, self-interested archetype s/he is. But then two episodes later, you'll find that you have sympathized with him/her. You'll find that you are interested by this character. And it's the same story with the ""good guys,"" but in reverse. You'll see cracks in honor, ulterior motives, yet still the character wouldn't simply be classed as ""false good, but in reality evil.""And I think, in fact the best way to summarize the characters is this: THEY FEEL REAL. That is SO rare in television today, especially in fantasy television.This review is getting long, so I'll be very brief on the rest. The plot is interesting and convoluted, but not pretentiously so. The action is of a good quality (there was one moment were I was a bit credulous, but it served the plot, so I was pleased nonetheless; crucially, you won't find anime protagonist stuff here. It feels about as real as you can get for this genre of television). The development of characters and their relationships is top notch. And the tension is both palpable and EARNED. That is not the case in other shows. And lastly, the world feels ancient and lived in.Just simply a great show. It stands alone among currently running fantasy television shows. And best of all, episode on is FREE ON YOUTUBE. What are you waiting for? Go watch it! I did, and let must say, I have NO intention of paying HBO to watch this show. But that YouTube episode was so good I didn't have a choice.It is worth your time. Go watch the free episode!"
"Unlike Game of Thrones that had likeable and heroic characters, every single character on House of the Dragon is flawed, morally compromised and unlikeable. There is no honour, no moral, you wouldn't aspire to be like any of them. You may say they're human, but even there good and bad humans and in this show they are mostly bad and lack integrity. You're supposed to root for Rhaenyera but even she is a liar and an incestuous manipulator who asks her uncle to kill her husband. I just can't, I don't care for any of the characters. Even Daemon, who's a complex and interesting character is terribly bad and I don't root for him. I just find that there are just simply some that are worse than others (for example Aegon is worst than his sister Rhaenyra Targaryen but it doesn't mean that she's good at all).The plot is good, all the writing, the acting, the plot line and intrigue. Also the production value and the CGI effects are amazing. The pace is also great, something happens on each episode, there's change, evolution, new information every time.It's annoying that they use the word ""f$&k"" several times that brings you back to modern writing. I wished they wouldn't be so sloppy.Finally, the elephant in the room: the race swapping. It is true that it doesn't make the story less interesting and it's true that the actor who plays Lord Corlys is a great actor (in spite of the ridiculous wig). However, it's annoying that in sake of complying with the ""diversity"" obligatory box, they race swap the Valyrians that according to the source material are explicitly ghostly white, with silver hair and purple eyes. Valyrians give a great importance to the perpetuation of the ethnicity and heritage and it feels cheap that George R. R. Martin bent the knee to please the woke crowd. This is disappointing and underwhelming.I think this show was so successful as well, because 2022 was a terrible year overall for entertainment and was the ""least bad"" among them all. Just as with its characters: they all bad but some are just less bad or worse than others."
"I was skeptical of this after being disappointed by game of thrones ending.And I wasn't too happy when i heard about the time jumps.But after watching it's been amazing, As someone who's read the book. It's really great to see that this show has changed /disproved some of the rumors in the book, many people don't pay attention that the book is written via 3rd hand accounts by maestors and mushroom etc.Watching the show play out via first hand accounts has been awesome, the minor changes to the show vs the book have been great imo like i said. I give it a 9.2 out of 10 so far.#teamblack #daemyraGame Of Thrones shoulda let Daenerys fulfill her destiny by restoring the house of the dragon to its proper glorys since she is from daemon/rhaenerys line!!!"
"(edit after episode 9) (my rating going up from 4/10 to 6/10 overall)If episodes 1 to 6 were weak (see below)... the show stepped up its game starting episode 7 (about time !!!). Still no epic breath but it is becoming rather interesting to watch, even if there are still flaws here and there... and there again ;)-----------------------------------------------------------------Where the hell the HBO developement & artistic team has gone ???!!! Was there any scriptwritting and directing supervision at all ??? They maybe just left the keys of the House to George RR Martin... thinking it would be enough for the magic to come back. Wrong ! The magic is gone...What a sloppy job. In nearly every department :"
"Insufficient plots & uninspired stories ou sub-stories - A lot of non-charismatic characters (or not developed enough) - Uninsipred dialogues (with a very few exceptions) - Directing with no angle or special point of view - Average acting............Absolutely NO EPIC BREATH.What a fall... It is sometimes even painfull to watch, while remembering/comparing to the GOT exciting and inspiring saga.""House of the dragons"" season 1 is barely an average show, with no flavour, weak and unimaginative most of the time.But who knows ? If creators and producers wake up right now, maybe it is not too late for a good season 2 and a rise above this creative accident. Let's hope so !"
"You'd expect a Game of Thrones like experience but this is nothing like it. Game of thrones had so many great characters and plots and it never got Boring. House of the Dragon just revolves around one house. Which personally I would have nothing against, but it just gets soooo boring.There are so many incoherences. For example a guy who murders various advisors in front of the king and queen who told him not to do it gets to keep being a kings guard. Or how everyone seems to age except Daemon.Also this series is even more gross than Game of Thrones when talking about violence. It just seems unnecessary and it's very disgusting.There is also so much unnecessary nudity and sex (which GoT also had but at least it was worth watching) .There are so many scenes which don't make any sence it's just enraging.Although this show fails to impress, the actors really did a great job. Emma D'arcy who plays older Rhaenyra really gives an excellent performance. Olivia Cooke and Paddy Considine also give really convincing performances. I also liked Matt Smith who plays Daemos because I have seen hin in different roles and he does a whole other thing.The makeup and costume department really deserve a great applause. They made every detail look so great and believable, it's just amazing.It's sad because if the writing hadn't been so bad this show really could have been something."
"I can't believe I'm here again, hyped for house of the dragon just as I was with game of thrones. I tried keeping my expectations low but after the first episode I'm already hooked. The cast is perfect, the ambience is straight up game of thrones (how I missed it) and the costume design? My god it's unreal! In the words of Michael Scott I'm ready to get hurt again."
I personally enjoyed it. I watched games of thrones during covid lockdown so couldn't wait for this series to come out. After it came out I waited till the season was done so I can binge em all at once ..as you know how much of a cliff hanger each eposide will end. Dragons lots of dragons love it! The story absolutely engaging. The actors superb. The climax for the last eposide has set the bar real high for the upcoming seasons. I can not wait ! High production value great story what you waiting for totally binge worthy! Daemon is my favorite lols. I hope the next season comes out in 2024 and not delayed as usual!
"Didn't have high hopes for House of Dragon being how frustrated and boring I found pretty much most of the final 3 seasons of GOT. I dont think I have or will ever see a series take such a nose dive in quality so severely in my life.... so I'm so happy to report how wrong I was, I thought House Of Dragon was GOT back to its best, crazy, unpredictable, twisted!! It's everything I enjoyed about this genre.... the casting was superb (which is always so important for me to be able to enjoy something) and the writing top notch..... its like the most screwed up soap opera on acid and me and my wife enjoyed every second. Cannot wait for the second season. My first ever 10 star review."
"I advise everyone to watch this series, the first episode was the greatest episode of a series in the world. The sound effects were awesomeThe beginning of Al-Aqsa was legendary."
"This series had an incredibly hard act to follow (if you pretend GoT S8 was just a bad dream). It was a little slow to get going in the initial episodes, but once the characters are fully in play it is a joy to behold. Daemon especially is a gift; less is more definitely more. The time jumps are a little hard to follow on occasion due to some actors changing/ some characters notably ageing, while others of a don't (Sir Criston seems to have stumbled on the fountain of youth). Definitely looking forward to more! I hope GRRM continues to be in involved - the storytelling is leagues better when he is."
"""House of the Dragon"" is one of the most highly anticipated television series of recent years, and for good reason. Based on George R. R. Martin's ""Fire & Blood"" novel, the show is set in the world of ""Game of Thrones"", but takes place 300 years before the events of the original series.One of the most exciting aspects of ""House of the Dragon"" is the opportunity to explore the rich history and lore of Westeros in greater depth. The show will delve into the Targaryen dynasty, one of the most powerful and fascinating families in the ""Game of Thrones"" universe, and shed light on events and characters that were only hinted at in the original series.The cast of ""House of the Dragon"" is also incredibly talented, featuring a mix of established actors and rising stars. With performances from the likes of Olivia Cooke, Matt Smith, and Paddy Considine, viewers can expect compelling and memorable characters that will leave a lasting impression.But perhaps the most exciting thing about ""House of the Dragon"" is the fact that it is being produced by the same team that brought ""Game of Thrones"" to life. With showrunner Ryan Condal and director Miguel Sapochnik at the helm, fans can expect the same level of quality and attention to detail that made the original series such a cultural phenomenon.Overall, ""House of the Dragon"" is shaping up to be an epic and unforgettable addition to the ""Game of Thrones"" universe. With its rich history, talented cast, and experienced creative team, it is sure to capture the imagination of audiences around the world."
"UPDATED REVEW: That time jump was awful. Shame on whoever thought his was a good idea. Can't believe GRRM has yet to finish his books and worked on something with this much of a huge mistake midway through the season. The actress who plays the Dragon Queen looks and acts nothing like her younger self. This is not artistic, it's just bad casting. The plot totally fell apart in Episode 6. The story was beyond incoherent.Prior to that, one thing I like about this show is that it isn't super complicated - or trying to recreate Game of Thrones - it is its own series. Now that the rules of Westeros are established in the mind of the audience, this show can just have fun with the palace intrigue of the Targaryen's.Matt smith was still great in it. And the dragons are cool."
The first thing you notice about this show...is the fantastic cinematography...it is mind-blowing...magnificent...all the scenes are as beautiful as beautiful can be...the pacing is fantastic...plot rolls forward at a good pace...allows you to feel every moment every scene...this being a prequel...we can't help but compare it to Game of thrones...the politics may not be as intricate or as nuanced...but they are just as interesting...there are not as many characters as game of thrones...but the character pool is enough...it is a story about one house anyway...character development however i have to say is not as meticulous...development of characters feels rushed...maybe coz of the show timeline...it jumps time too many times...the characters as they grow...not very convincing...it's not easy to pull it off though i understand...not the director's fault...or the head of screenplay...they didn't need to do soo many though...they could have used make-up maybe...i mean Daemon remains the same through all the ages...the acting is fantastic...the only one who falls short is Criston...not meticulous at all...too many mistakes...the actor almost under-acts...you might say it's what he was going for but no...i wouldn't be convinced...others though were flawless...Daemon especially...the actor captures all the nuances...even the little negligible emotions....the best character if you ask me...teenage Rhaenyra is acted better than adult Rhaenyra...it's almost laughable...they should have just kept the same actor...halfway through the season...it almost hits a low you feel the show may not recover from...but luckily it does pull itself out of that pit...although awkwardly but totally...it's a fantastic game of thrones prequel though...very well done...true to the mood atmosphere and aura of Westeros...
"We've seen it all before. Whereas GoT spent time world building, the audience already knows this Weteros. Two centuries earlier, there aren't enough differences.The story jumps ahead months, years and even a decade between episodes with little of importance happening in between. Six episodes in and I can't tell what the central theme is.I mentioned GoT earlier. That series started well with many very good seasons. GoT unfortunately ended poorly with many very bad seasons. HotD is just mediocre. It's boring. At least the early seasons of GoT had a lot of sexual tension, gratuitous sex, nudity and violence to keep things interesting. We get very little of that here.The point is, HotD is boring. It's just passable."
"Idk how the writers could have been so stupid to recast 2 main beloved characters but they did. Emotional attachment gone. I like it untill the character change, a bit slow tho but definitely a 7. Now a 2. Why put in new characters you can just make them look older like they did with less interesting cast members 🤦🏻Idk how the writers could have been so stupid to recast 2 main beloved characters but they did. Emotional attachment gone. I like it untill the character change, a bit slow tho but definitely a 7. Now a 2. Why put in new characters you can just make them look older like they did with less interesting cast members 🤦🏻"
"Everything was great, the only thing that I missed was that the King didn't have as much energy and wasn't looking as power-welding as Robert Baratheon.Cinematography was great, although the dragons' CGI was okay-ish; though it should not be judged only on the basis of first episode.The episode really increased my hype for further episodes as it moved on."
"After three episodes, I gave a rating of 9. Then after finishing the season, I changed it. It deserves an absolute well deserving 10. I got the chance to read the book and the book was very informative as it goes back before the show events then it continues to where the show is starting. I love Game of thrones but I wouldn't call it one of the best shows I have seen, but house of dragon is definitely one of the best shows I have seen or at least I would say one of my absolute favorites. Hope we don't have to wait a year or more for a new season. The only thing I didn't like was the actor playing young Rhaenyra. Other than this, everything was perfect."
"Definitely a good follow on from the game of throne franchise. The characters acting skills are very good and the sets are fantastically put together.I did not like the character change through the middle of the series. Although the aging processes of the king is very well done. There are some shocking sections to the series I would not recommend watching while children are around as it does contain graphic scenes.The dragons look incredible also. The CGI on them make them look very realistic.Would definitely recommend, it is worth a watch but hopefully it won't be a let down at the end."
"The show runners were aware of the problems of the last GOT episodes and said more than once that they want to make this right and avoid mistakes of the past. Yet you still have bitter fans hating on it, even now that the first episode is released, and it's obvious how good this show is going to be. As someone who worked on this show I knew from the start that it's going to be good but I had to keep my mouth shut. All I'm saying now is that the best is yet to come. Let the haters hate. Everyone else, enjoy it."
Dragons and is ok. But the setup and visuals are amzing enoung to hook u if u didt watch GOT. NO PROB GO FOR IT. Got fans hav a treat again. Loved it.
This show has the Game of thrones feel but it is clearly it's own show and can stand on its own legs. You can tell it's different and not the same thing as GOT. I love seeing a hood balance between action and politics and of course the drama. This show has the best actors I have seen and I absolutely love Rhaenyra played by Milly Alcock!!! This for me even beats out GOT season 1 for me. Absolutely love it!! I also love that they give symbolism and talk about topics that are in a way still relevant today. They have a great eye for detail and the plot is amazing. I see no flaw with the show. The pacing is great though some may argue otherwise however in order to not bore viewers it is needed in my opinion.
"Can't stand it at all. None of the Characters are appealing, none of them is attractive. The princess and the King.....man. Just can't compare to the old dragon princess. I hope she will grow old later and the king will die soon. Violence or sex, none. The fighting horrible. The new lord of the rings, i would say way better, but i don't get why people rate this much higher, for that i will rate it a 6, usually it would be a 7. One more episode i will save my time for something outs. Starting to this is going to be dissappointing. The 1st look of all those characters already make me feel they are trying to find some mediocre actors and actresses to play the shows, now the feeling continues. I was thinking at least the story or the CG would be exciting, not at all after a few scences of showing off the dragons, excitement are all gone after #2."
"A lovely return to the mythology of GRR Martin. After the vomit-covered train wreck of GOT Season 8's last 2 episodes, we need a return to sense and sensibility. This is a true return to form - court intrigue, the majestic arc of history, absolutely compelling and mesmerizing characters, perversion and depravity, and dragons, oh so many dragons.We live in an age where for some foolish reason, some powers are convinced spectacle suffices in place of plot and character development. A certain global online retailer has been proven wrong via a certain competitive fantasy series. HOD sticks to tried, tested and true formulae - develop your play and the actors with equal fervour - get your audience to CARE and empathize with their motivations. Can I just say the casting of HOD is absolutely magnificent? Every single character is credible and realistic.King Viserys Targaryen is a visionary leader, the rare monarch who struggles to unite rather than divide and seeks peace rather than war. He tries to do the right thing for history but keeps getting dragged down to older, evil ways. He is good at heart, all love him. A truly admirable man.Daemon Targaryen his brother is the definition of cool. Unflappable, steel-willed, brutally courageous and fiercely loyal, the most underestimated player in this new game. His single-handed silent battle sequence will go down in TV history. I can't wait to see what else this mad, sensible and honourable prince does in future seasons.Those craving dragons get their bellies stuffed. All manner of sizes and ages, majestic names. We get far more background into exactly how the Valyrians of old tamed these airborne nuclear fortresses. I am indeed intrigued and wish for Valyria of old. If this series stays true and the showrunners do not repeat the mistakes of GOT's conclusion, I expect and demand 2 more epic prequels - the conquests of Aegon the conqueror and the Doom of Old Valyria.At the heart of this first epic season is the doomed - pun intended - friendship of Rhaenys Targaryen and Alicent Hightower. We see two young women growing up as pawns in a big game played and owned by men, struggling to make their way in the world and earning it, instead of having it dropped into their laps. We see them struggle to stay true to their duty and blood, at the cost of their friendship. These sisters will continue to define this series for years to come. The searing, painful end of the season 1 finale was expected but still shocking. In a single moment you can see a grieved woman shed her skin of restraint and become a terrible dragon, ruthless and determined. This impetus will yield a fiery and bloody season 2 of greater pain and horror."
"I knew from the very short preview before the series came out, that there was not any likable characters in this & now that it has came out i see my feeling was correct. In the original there were MANY likable characters, although they,d get killed too soon. There is not one beauty, where the original had multiple. It is just lacking overall, with bland characters. The actors are certainly not bad, just lacking any sparkle, or ""character"" which would endear them to the viewer, for me it's rather bland, although i keep watching it hoping it shall turn a corner and burst into life, yet it does not, it just meanders along. Authentic looking for sure, nice dragons, yet overall ""Sterile"", possibly bad casting & not an interesting enough story. Even after 7 episodes i have not developed ANY concern nor likeness for ANY character, so obviously where the story meanders to will have little effect unless they inject it with some Real characters/actors whom you have SOME feeling for. It's not terrible, just lacking sparkle & somewhat mundane overall."
"I am not sure what do they want to show by releasing the episodes at the 10x speed. One episode you are in present year and then the next you are in 20th. Stopped watching it the moment they changed/replaced the lead characters in episode 6. Extremely disappointed. I finally had started to like princess and the queen's character but then they had to replace them.Or maybe I am expecting too much from this show by directly comparing it to the greatest of all ""Game of Thrones"".I am not sure if I will start watching the show again but for now, I am going to skip it. Also, the dragons aren't interesting anymore."
"Set several hundred years before the events depicted in GRRM's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" (and the HBO program ""Game of Thrones"") HotD provides some of the preceding history for Westeros and the eternally warring or power-jockeying major houses that exist there.I think anyone who liked the first 4-5 seasons of GoT (don't get me started on how they later ruined it) will really enjoy HotD for its good writing and acting as well as the dragons. They clearly didn't spend as much time using real-life locations as the producers of GoT did, but no real complaints there since we're mainly dealing with 3 houses and not the continent spanning scope of the previous series yet.I was glad they introduced the dragons right away and that they don't rely too much on them as GoT did toward the end of that series. There are dragons, one family made up of 2 houses controls them. No suspense and this series doesn't push the CGI super hard like the end of GoT did.As far as the story/plot, it hews pretty closely to the source material. More so than GoT did, anyway. That said, there are several time jumps, one of them pretty major and that was initially jarring. Due to the nature of the three families/houses involved (Targaryan, Valerian and Hightower), and their very similar if not exactly the same given names, it can get confusing keeping track of who's who, especially once the third generation of characters is born and grows up. There are two Aegons (in addition to the Aegon of lore) for one thing, which can be especially confusing and a lot of the names sound a lot alike.They also could have been a little more creative with the opening sequence and theme song, which sounds like a slightly different key version of GoT's, but I have to admit it does bring back good memories of when that series premiered and it's a pretty good song. Regarding the lead in sequence, it's not as wide ranging or informative as GoT's was, but it looks very well conceived and executed.So far there aren't any plot holes or major loose ends and the story is progressing linearly (along with the time jumps) toward the conclusion of Season One. With just two episodes remaining, I'm hoping they don't try to cram too much of the story into this season and let it unfold smoothly and spaced out in the next (if it's renewed and I think it has been).If you're looking for some fun, intriguing, sometimes brutal fantasy television with Shakespearean machinations, I highly recommend House of the Dragon. It's definitely more on par with my tastes than the other currently running fantasy series based (very loosely) on JRR Tolkien's writing on Amazon. That one I'd recommend for kids and teens; this one is geared toward adults.8/10 and please keep up the good work (cough, cough final seasons of GoT)."
"No it's not gonna be GOT, there is only one GOT, but the action was good, the dialogue was above average, the setup was perfect. Sorry to tell the distractors that you can't have all the emotional hooks and the excitement from watching GOT after one episode. The first season of GOT there was very little action and I stopped watching it for a bit. The reality is this is a new show, as such it will take time to get to know the characters and love or hate them. Overall I'm happy and wish I could watch the whole season today and the next season tomorrow. Have high hopes!"
"I have to say, this series turned out to be better than I expected. While I don't think that it's perfect or in the same league as ""Game of thrones"", it still managed to be very enjoyable and rather compelling at times.Smith and Considine were the biggest highlights of the first season (I'm definitely going to miss the latter). I wasn't fan of Ifans as Otto at first, but he took me over as the show went on. Special praise goes to actresses that played young Rhaenyra and Alicent. While they seemed a bit unconvincing in first episode, they vastly improved and I hope both of them will have bright future in cinema and TV.Music and sets were amazing and probably the most enjoyable part of the show. CGI for dragons was, while not great, satisfying enough for a TV show.However, there were few flaws that I found difficult to overlook. First one being the pacing. At times it went too fast which really damaged some of the episodes, and nowhere was it as problematic as in episode 6, which was by far the weakest episode of the series so far. In this episode, both Rhaenyra and Daemon lost their significant others but their deaths lacked the impact they should have had because of how little time we spent with them. I also wasn't fan of some of the performances. Actors who played Rhaenyra's sons were insufferable at some points, although it can be excused due to their age. Biggest ""stinker"" was Larys Strong, whose character came off as way too cartoonish for a show with such serious tone.Than there was also an issue with race swapping of Velaryons. While, to be fair, actors that played them all did good job, race swapping completely removed any ambiguity over the identity of Rhaenyra's sons, ruining that plotline and making Viserys and Corlys look like oblivious idiots. It was a move that obviously wasn't well thought out by creators and it shows.Despite this flaws, I still liked this show and I'm definitely going to miss it. Hopefully, season 2 will iron out all of season 1's flaws and become even better.9/10."
"Like many, I felt the series finale of GoT to be a bit of a let down. With House of the Dragon, it is a fresh take on the world of GoT.What we saw in this series has already been decided. The history of Westeros from GoT tell us the end. But now it is up to the writers to tell the story.The final episode of Season 1 has kicked off what fans of the GoT universe know as The Dance of Dragons. I look forward to the release of Season 2. Blood and Cheese, the madness of Queen Helaena Targaryen, and (of course) the beginning of the end of the Targaryen's true power.Also to those who have seen the animated GoT videos that illustrate Westeros's history, The Dance of Dragons by Shireen, Viserys & Others has definitely aged well."
This review comes from someone who has read Fire & Blood and I will do some comparisons but will try to judge it as its own thing (no spoilers for future seasons). This review will be uppdated after every season.Season 1:Positivs:
"The show looks great with fantastic cgi, direction, cinematography and production design.The performance are fantastic with my favorite being Viserys, old Rhanyra and young Alicent.The score is fantastic although I wish for a new title theme.Negatives:"
The pacing/time jumps: The show really struggles with so much story in so little time. It needed atleast 2 more episodes to flesh out the story.Character aging: The show is very inconsistent with the characters ages. Alicent and Rhanyra switch actors and Viserys slowly desintegreats but Rhanys looks the same at the Harrenhall council and the end which is more than 20 years. Same for Deamon and Cole who both looks the same after 20 years. They didnt need to switch actors but some makeup would be nice.Conclusion: HotD is a good succesor with a few problems which should be solved next season.
"The show gets better after the first couple episodes. The first had some weird shock moments and second felt like nothing happened...but then the story finally got interesting in episode 3. Will keep watching, I wasn't sure after the first two."
"This is one of those shows that will pick pace, so far the first season has been very introductory and slow on the violence and drama. That's not a bad thing, remember that GoT screwed up the 7th and 8th seasons just to push into the disappointing ending faster.The high points of that show were the mythology, the mysteries of the red woman, etc. Things that deserve a lower pace to be explained.I mean, I really like it, very carefully crafted, good acting, superb soundtrack, superb visuals and of course the story is very interesting.Why detracting a star? Because I want to see how things progress and I didn't like subtle wokeness that they tried to shoehorn on it.So far a fan, but a watchful fan."
"Up to Ep 6 and so far the scale is large but the plot is dull, too much soap opera.Also some of the acting and lines are occasionally laughable, with the actors taking themselves far to seriously with clumsy delivery, it's as if they are reading the lines for the first time.Another interesting outtake is that in the quest to appear 'big' it views as pretend Shakespeare, mixing up the language to appear regal or ancient, all a bit forced. In particular the drama build is slow and at times very, very slow.Some of the blonde wigs are just silly.I hope it improves, okay so far, just a bit dull, if the story is building it better get a move along, Ep 6 was really boring and I no longer look forward to the next episode."
"Our family is a big GoT fan, and we've stuck with HotD thinking things will pick up eventually. Instead, Episode 6 was one of the worst that one could have expected from the GoT franchise.In my opinio, it's hard to pin point one thing wrong - the speed, or characters, or the storyline. The treatment of the story is akin to a family drama. As some other reviewers have pointed out, it just feels like a whole different series, and the director's attempts at scenes to shock you leave you well... disgusted.The political drama that is central to GoT is lackluster in HotD and somehow overly focussed on gender roles rather than a strong storyline.Not coming back for the next episode."
I loved this world in this series and i wanna back to this moment i can live there with kings but i know my luck i will be a made.Every details in this series is amazing we can live with targryan family through tv
Im from egypt which you know same cultures between pharaohs and targryans so i proud to be egyptain and watch this series
Acting is so perfect and so beautiful
Love demon more than any character because he know his goals and try to do it
Renera is confusing character untill now
Thanks fire and blood thanks gorge martin to this trophy u deserve to be the most creative writer in this world i have ever seen.
"GOT was and he is still a masterpiece, but this already is hitting the fans. New characters, new adventures and more violence and sex than before... the perfect recipe for a pure mix of drama, emotions and fun, as always delievered by HBO and George R. Martin."
"As a huge GOT fan and a reader of the books, I can easily say that this serie makes me remember the first seasons of the original serie. But with better CGI and better set designs. With the release of the 4. Episode, I am really impressed with this series progression and its highly detailed usage of symbolism. Every scene is highly deteailed with the excellent work of mise-en-scene and foreshadows the forecoming episodes through a highly elegant way. I am just happy to say that this serie is and will be great as the original GOT.""The only thing that could tear down the house of the dragon was itself"" - Rhaenyra Targaryen."
"I have been a GOT fan since forever, i truly believed that no show will ever replace it, but trust me, since the first episode i knew, i knew this is the one that will dethrone GOT of course if the production team didn't affect the course of the events like they did in GOT.It's episode 1 yet but trust me you can hear the music, you cannot predict the plot, you can't feel it's acting at all since the actors did an amazing jobi truly hope that this show succeed."
"I literally has goosebumps, It's gonna be the next big thing and it's gonna surpass the game of thrones.And it has a potential to break records!It has the vibe where it all requires, didn't miss game of thrones characters at all, the character build ups are intense and the audacity is insane. I'm super excited and can't wait for the second episode. My hopes are enormously high!"
"I think all those who absolutely expected a brilliant GoT remake, that is, this epic exposition of an entire continent and dozens of players of all its regions right at the beginning, must inevitably be disappointed. Because HotD obviously doesn't seem to be designed that way.I like this refreshingly different, more chamber-game-like approach to a particular point in this world. Not everything always has to be in the style of an epic. And also not always necessarily develop there.But if the story continues to be told so carefully and sensitively and played so convincingly and differentiated, I will continue to feel very entertained.9 honest points +1 to compensate for dishonest 1 star ratings."
"This is obviously not as good as Game of Throne but, at the same time, we can see something that remind of it. It's not a bad product but I think that everyone can easily predict every single thing in every single episode. There is nothing that surprise about the plot or the characters decisions. It seems that the screenwriters didn't care enough to make an effort to develops something near the greatness of GOT. I'm a little concern about the way this kind of products are developed today. It seems that nobody cares about the coherence of the plot and the characters. The only thing that matters is making money."
"What's with the bad reviews? Anything below 8 stars is the result of marketing, I want my review published so I wont say more. Thank you for muzzling us. Aaaanyway, the series is getting better and better, the plot makes sense, the tension is there without being explained anything, it's organic, well done writing. I love the costumes as well and next episode is going to be cathartic, they are building up to that. The actors' changes didn't ruin it, I found myself more immersed in it tnx to Emma D'Arcy. Now that's someone that has a good material and can play a figure, no longer just a character. Trying not to spoil because it's worth watching it. In an age of watching comical reviews on youtube rather than the show itself, HOTD is not to be missed!P. S. : Amazing episode 10 to prepare the grounds for season 2. How could they do so much regarding imagery, costumes, CGI, soundtrack, locations with much less (if you know what i mean)?"
"This show has a solid start, for 3 or 4 episodes, and then...nothing. Not nothing, but what a mess? This almost isnt GoT, just familiy affairs, royality intrigue and some sex sceens and miscarriage of babies more then once. We have one dispute in practice area and some children figth. Meh. Where are the battles, armies march on each other, where are the complex characters (good that you care about, bed that you hate)? Just, storytelling is rushed, I do not care about any character in series (and I do not hate anyone). I have a feeling that thay have story for solid 4 episodes, but they manage to have whole season of it."
They've beautifully taken the vague history based narrative of fire and blood and placed its plot story and characters in a believable and nostalgic world that even people who have never seen the original can enjoyThey've beautifully taken the vague history based narrative of fire and blood and placed its plot story and characters in a believable and nostalgic world that even people who have never seen the original can enjoy.

"Have seen 1st episode of this season. Just got flash back of game of thrones end and that city.kings landing, winterfell people talks about that no one can compite privious carectors, ofcourse in previous season all were marvelous but in this season have something to watch you can smell reality and goosebumps when you see iron throne. Just amazing. Valarmorgulis to all."
"Love the series, but nothing is without its flaws. I only hope they can give this one a good conclusion! But on a serious note the cgi is questionable at times (maybe they were afraid to give it there all due to GOT tanking the last season, not sure lol) also all the time jumps feels like a disservice to the actresses and actors.. This series branches from a dearly loved universe so I don't think anybody would complain had they slowed it down a bit. However GOT having such a slow 1st season gives me a little reasoning to this. All I'm saying is it would have been nice to see Milly Alcock and Emily Carey grow into their characters as nearly all other actors and actresses of the previous GOT series got to do so. Also maybe a few flash backs with King Viserys and Balerion would have been cool!!!! This damn dragon has been teased more times than I can count on all my fingers and toes lol."
"What a visually striking show. The cast is brilliant, costume majestic and the eerie atmosphere it has created from the beginning is beyond imagination. Looking forward to where this show go from here. Because after those awful last seasons of GOT, we are scared of how they will break our heart."
It's a much awaited series for every GOT lover. I watched whole GOT in 14 days only. It was a great series and will be always number 1 for me. GOT is emotion for all the series lover. HOTD is the successful prequel for GOT. It shows great story from the 1st episode. I was very much impressed with the work. Stunning vfx and very good storyline. Another masterpiece from George R. R Martin. Hoping for a great journey with this series. All the characters will be remembered like GOT. It is only the beginning and the series is getting critical acclaim form all over the world. Hoping for a great work and will be waiting after the 1st season.
"House of the dragon did show us the inevitable power of hbo and all the crew of making a series completed in every way. The acting, the cast, the visuals(we cant watch it without being jawdropped in every scene), the story, fire and blood, the costumes are the definition of mindblowing. I really encourage all people from different backgrouds (politics, fiction, drama, epic, war...). The emotions actually harmonize with the logic creating an amazing masterpiece. Thats why it competes with game of thrones with all its energy and its fandom. At every end of episode you won't stop thinking at what will happen in the next ep. Im so satisfied for now and so exited for the next episodes."
The first episode felt like nothing happened. There was a tournament with no real stakes and the wife died but this isn't interesting at all. The second episode had promises of some interesting action at least but nothing. I enjoy plotting and planning as much as action but this was only plotting with no real outcome. The first episode and season of GOT was amazing. This was just boring.At first I thought the actor choice was random but that has grown on me. With a 6/10 I will keep watching and I see a potential for a 7/10 but that cannot compare to the 10/10 that early GOT was.I know the writer is working on the show. If he writes this badly how is the final book gonna be?
"4 episodes in and I am really enjoying this show. It's visually stunning and the characters are wel portrayed. I do agree that this show is of an entire different pacing than GOT, but what do you expect? Apart from the fact that we are still ONLY 4 episodes in, This show involves around 1 house whereas The story of GOT is something of a completely different magnitude.Apart from that, I really hope that the story keeps picking up, because yes: it is a slow burn.... But the fact that the acting is superb (and actors well casted) and that every episode is visually a piece of art, makes it all worthwhile."
"Perhaps concern for how the great Father, Eddard Stark, might ever be redeemed was not the hook for all viewers ensnared by the first season of GoT, and yes, the focus for this series is obviously on the Targaryens and the rulers of King's Landing -chivalry is dead here, and its history is grimy and incestuous- but despite how Martin may/may not have written these characters/this story, how can there not be a single seemingly respectable male character in this entire introduction?? (save for *maybe* the sole token black man- ok, ep 02, he's out too) --even the discerning Hand turns out to be despicable POS.Can a female lead not be well-liked by/endeared upon an audience these days without drowning us in her oppressive environment, packing it entirely with unwise/small and underdeveloped privileged white men??I don't understand how writers/directors/producers expect people to want to watch just the Bad and the Ugly... sure, an insight or two into the injustices of the patriarchy, fine, but were this not a flagship show (touted to be among the most expensive productions in history) I would perceive this differently.Not single compelling character, and I hope this beat to death ""eff the patriarchy"" theme is not all that remains prominent throughout the show, can't see how it might hope to strongly progress/develop otherwise."
"First five episodes was probably the worst thing that I watched since a long time. I honestly didn't expect this worst but, they some how managed to even exceed my limits of imagination.Until now (from episode 1 to 5), overall narrative was the most boring tv-series ever. There was no twist, or no proper conflict. Even if there were some conflict, they were unnoticed and get lost through the badly written soap opera characters. From major roles to minor ones, any character arc was neither interesting, nor consistent. They somehow managed to write the dialogs in unnecessarily theatrical tone, and also paradoxically managed to write them extremely dull as well.I really congratulate the writers and director for this mess. It must be really hard to achieve that amount of lack of quality, in their massive production budget. Although, I don't blame any actor on this... No great actor in the world could save this visionless and very boring tv-series episodes in a row."
"I have watched 3 episodes of House of the Dragon and I must say it grabbed my attention. If I compare it with Game of Thrones, this show started with more action but I shouldn't expect to see Game of Thrones here because it is about house of Targaryen. It's easier to adapt to the characters in this show because there aren't as many characters as Game of Thrones. It has great visual effects, script and acting. I really enjoyed watching it so far.I like Game of Thrones also but this is not a fan comment. I just don't understand people who give 5 points or less. If they wanted to make money from this series just by using the name Game of Thrones, they would have broadcast the other series (Bloodmoon)."
The day I know this is related to games of thrones...I start watching it. One of the best shows of 2022. Every episode is different with suspense. People who don't like it...please go and mind ur business. Plzzz give it try if u watched games of thrones. You going to love it. The picturing and direction of the show is awesome. Every time there is dragon in episodes I love it. All the characters in show are awesome. It's all about politics and taking of power from each other. I can't wait before they bring new season. Once again. Plz don't go with bad reviews. Give it try. If u haven't watched games of thrones. Then don't try.
"What a joy to be able to return to a place that brought us so many emotions. House of the Dragon manages to convey the atmosphere of the richest and most opulent period of Westeros with a perfect sense of veiled intrigue until we get to the point where spirits are high and it's impossible to keep the peace. The performances are impeccable. In my opinion Paddy Considine is amazing as Viserys, the great center of the first season. Anyway, as a Targaryen fan, it's impossible not to be very happy with the appearance of each one of them, and best of all: in a coherent way and with a great script. I hope the show maintains the highest level of quality."
"All the hype, the wait is over! This episode is slightly different from GOT season one episode 1, but it's very entertaining lots of blood, sex and violent! And of course dragonsUnfortunately I can't say ""north remembers"" can't wait fir the next episode ðŸ˜Ž"
Better than the last season of Got Goddamm that last season was horrible but this looks like it could surpass the last one the pilot episode was really really good everything was perfect.
"Game of thrones really didn't pick up until a few episodes in and this took a couple to pick up speed as well. From episode four things have gotten really interesting and I've thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Beautifully filmed, set design is wonderful as is costume as is acting (Paddy Constantine and quite frankly all of the cast have been awesome)I'll admit it hasn't been perfect but neither was the first season of Game Of Thrones, let's be honest. I'd even go as far to place this above the first season of game of thrones. It took a bit of getting used to until around the third episode but since then it hasn't slowed down and I've been enjoying the ride and am looking forward to seeing what else is in store."
"Pros: The dragons are beautifully animated and there are some fascinating characters. Matt Smith as Daemon is just perfect and Viserys is great too.Cons: Far from the well structured storytelling of the GOT first seasons. I have to concentrate to not let my attention wander. They introduced a lot of characters, and after I finished the whole season I still don't know why. The motivation of the characters is confusing at best. So their decision making is chaotic. Sometimes their choice is against everything that they done till that. I think the intent was to make some mystical atmosphere, but it ends up short, only a muddy story."
Just finished the 5th episode and I have to say it was awesome. I was a skeptic at first if this prequel could stand on it's own. I don't understand why people after seeing 1 or 2 episodes can give it a bad rating. Unlike GOT the focus is one house so you don't get the number of story arcs. The characters are getting fleshed out and the show stands on its own strengths. Plus they have source materials to go off of.I feel like the last two seasons of GOT were rushed and suffered due to its massive story arcs. House of the Dragon has more nuanced character arcs as you don't have all the kingdoms to cover and it allows you to start to really understand the layers of this very complicated and odd house.
"We are now five episodes in and this is one long, bloated, awkward, soap-opera, over dramatic, snooze fest. Where is the action? Where are the dragons, minus a flew fly-by's? Where is the excitement? Where is the intrigue? Where is the surprise? Everything we are seeing, we have seen a million times before. And all of it is predictable. I think the only really fun sequence was the mad dash by Damon the defeat the Crab King. I cant think of any others that were actually fun or interesting. We go from one gross sexual exploit to the next...If we wanted the never ending awkward love triangles, there are plenty of places in the history of television where we could find that. We are here for something special and something unique, like we got with the original GoT series.I am sure this is building towards some more interesting final episodes but I don't see how many fans would find these first several episodes to be of any real quality."
"House of The Dragon - Well, the acting is not bad, the music is recognizable, the cinema photography is clean and delivered well.BUT.....The reality.... The story is terrible and boring. There's zero excitement, nothing to grasp so far that keeps you wanting more. The problem is, its centred around one location and 2-3 main characters - each episode just ends up feeling very flat.Game of Thrones has literally set such a high standard, the first series had us all hooked. If you loved GOT, you wont dislike House of The Dragon because it has GOT vibes...I hope it gets better, I really do."
"This series is a prequel done well. It acts as a great homage to a fanbase hungry for more after Game of Thrones ended, also somewhat controversially and rushed.There is less inside this series than the more expansive Game of Thrones series, but what it does on a smaller level, it does well. You'll get to see warring factions, intrigue, dragons and gory betrayal. There's not a lot not to like. At times the series runs slow so I did find myself tapping in and out. As the series progresses, it crescendos into a narrative that you can't stop watching and I eagerly look forward to the second season!"
This first episode of the series was absolutely amazing. I didn't have the highest of hopes for this show but looked forward nevertheless to dive back into the politics and bloodshed of Westeros. I was not let down the slightest and I'm looking forward to the next episode.
"I didn't expect much from a prequel, instead I'm enjoying it very much: human dramas on the scene more than dragons and fantasy gadgets, high level of performances. The most outstanding character besides Raynera is Daemon with a wonderful Matt Smith. He is simply perfect! Ambiguous at the beginning, mysterious, sexy... When he appears or talks, the screen is overwhelmed by his presence. Someone suggested that Henry Cavill should have this part. NO WAY! He is so common compared to Matt Smith who, by the way, has shown outstanding performances in other tv series (The Crown) and movies (Mapplethorpe)."
"Season 1 of House of the Dragon shows great promise in adapting one of the most popular tales from GRRM's History of Westeros and the Targaryen Dynasty.Where a Game of Thrones takes place after the fall of the Targaryen Kings, House of the Dragon shows us the Targaryens at the apex of their power when the biggest threat to their reign was themselves.GRRM wrote this story over many years, first appearing in bits and pieces from differing perspectives and detail as novellas in anthology novels. Finally, in 2018 GRRM published the novel, ""Fire and Blood,"" which has the most detailed account of the brutal Targaryen civil war, known to Westerosi history as, ""The Dance of Dragons.""George RR Martin, is a huge fan of using the ""unreliable narrator"" in his stories to highlight how truth is always a matter of perspective and information and hardly ever black or white. Many critics did not care for GRRM's choice to write ""Fire and Blood"" as a historical account based on a Grand Maester's and a Court Jester's accounts.House of the Dragon is taking this opportunity to use a COMPLETED work from GRRM this time but having the liberty to tell the tale from the perspective of those living it instead of a ""historical account"" perspective. I believe that having the completed source material could allow this series be better than A Game of Thrones.Firstly, the casting, setting, costumes, and effects are top notch and what you would expect form HBO. The actors do a great job of providing depth and development to these characters which was not seen in the novels since it was a historical narrative. It is well documented that King Viserys Targaryen reigned during long decades of peace in the realm and that, while not a tyrannical or inept King, he was not the best suited to the decisiveness and confidence that a King should possess. Paddy Considine brings a humor and tragedy to this character that makes you feel the crushing weight the war between the Love of a Father and the Duty to the Realm of a King. Hi Decades long demise is agonizing and frustrating until a war between the ""Greens"" and the ""Blacks"" is all but assured.I felt that the pacing and the acting was excellent and that the decision veer away from constant sex, nudity, and violence, that plagued A Game of Thrones, in later seasons, was most welcome.Many years pass from episode 1 - 10 and there is ample time to get to know the major players of this story without the feeling of being dragged along. The inclusion of much more CGI to bring the dragons to life was not overly used and I felt accurately showed how just the presence of an adult dragon was sufficient for almost any type of negation. The effects artists have also done a great job of creating a unique look for each dragon based on the source material. It is truly staggered to see the difference in size between, Vhagar, the last living Dragon of Aegon the Conqueror, and most of the other living dragons. The dragons are a huge part of this story so I was glad to see that got this right.If you are looking to get a chance to travel back to the world of Westeros but still hesitant because of the final season of A Game of Thrones, you owe it to yourself to give this services a chance. I believe that the final season of this series will be very different from what we got with A Game of Thrones!"
"Forget about Rings of Power, this is the show you want to see.I'll be honest. I had some reservations about how well would House of the Dragon be capable to deliver the world of George R. R. Martin. And deliver it does.Not only does it feel like Game of Thrones, but the cast is for the most part very well chosen. With most actors and actresses, delivering solid performances and being capable of pulling us into their world, their lives, their intrigues, their agendas. But above all making the viewer care about those characters.Not that many shows can claim to be able to do that. But this one can. And it's good because after season 8 of Game of Thrones, the story needed to be focused on something else that makes us forget about that season.And although the fall of House Targaryen is something we know it's going to happen no matter what, at least the show is being done well enough that even knowing that, doesn't really matter. It's a show that has proven to have what it takes to be seen and appreciated.My only hope right now is that the success doesn't go to their heads, and they start making rookie mistakes. Game of Thrones lost the race in the last meters of the race, so I really hope that House of the Dragon doesn't make the same mistake.Other than that three episodes in, and this show has come out strong and with enough fire to burn long and wide, instead of burning bright and fading just as fast.This show is definitely a must see. And those that don't watch it will only lose."
"I scored it a slightly hopeful 7, hopeful that it will improve. At the moment it is looking a little predictable, The King is ill so presume he's going to kark it, they're throwing the young daughter of the Kings hand in front of him so that's going to go somewhere, might she get pregnant and give him a son? Then there is Dr Who skulking around waiting to cause no end of problems. Did I miss anything? It's early days so we will have to wait and see but one of the strong points of GoT was that it could be unpredictable.... Hope they know that."
"An epic episode a visual feast in true Thrones fashion I genuinely Can't remember looking forward to a show as much as I have been for House of the Dragon absolutely great writing, with meaningful decisions being made, fantastic character development, Paddy Considine absolutely killied this episode the conflict King Viserys is obviously feeling is highlighted perfectly in the scene in front of the fire with his daughter you absolutely felt his pain and understood the pressure of being the ruler of the iron thrown. This show just keeps getting better and better, 3 episodes in and I'm totally invested in these characters. GREAT GREAT GREAT!HBO have a massive hit on there hands and should be congratulated on making a quality show that people will keep coming back to again and again.A show others can only envy."
"First episode is 103 minutes long. 10 minutes is decent drama. <5 minutes is a little hamfisted 'action'. We've got the 'ole tiddy shot. The problem is that outside of those 15 minutes it's basically dead air. You could summarize the first episode into a 18 minute segment without missing anything of importance.Without going into a lot of detail, think back to Star Wars. The original trilogy was fantastic. Then came the prequel trilogy, with the second movie Attack of the Clones being the worst of the prequel trilogy. That's what this series is to the original, Attack of the Clones.Original Game of Thrones series started off at a 9/10 and became a 7/10 by the end of things. House of the Dragon is starting off at a 7/10.Personally I thought it was pretty boring which isn't a good sign because first episodes of a season are supposed to be the best. Especially when it is a new series. Hopefully I am wrong and it gets better later. My advice is to not get your hopes up."
"1) In a tv series like HOTD or GOT, charisma is more important than acting skills. Sophie Turner/ Kit Harington/ Nikolaj Coster-Waldau etc, were not the best actors of the world but they were charismatic and magnetic. They shined on the screen. Peculiar faces/the way they speak and move etc. Of course, it helps if you are both charismatic and great actor. Like Sean Bean or Lena Headey. There are some great and charismatic actors in HOTD too, like Ifans/Smith/ Considine etc. (Considine literally commands the room, there is an episode here which he gives probably the best performance of both GOT and HOTD). However, there are others with Common faces, zero charisma and mediocre acting skills. They shouldn't be here. I don't want to name them, but it's obvious i think.2) I haven't read the books. I don't care if there are some changes in adapted screenplay, as long as i am being entertained. Some things here don't make much sense, especially during the first four episodes. I didn't like much the first episodes. At times, it's like i was watching a parody of Game of Thrones. There were some positives too. But the sum of it was really flawed.3) Nevertheless, HOTD keeps getting better and better during the second half. Dialogues are sharper, tension rises, viewer cares more about the characters. To be honest, i would prefer if it was less morally grey, i mean, it's like every character here is a villain. But it doesn't matter much, as long as the show has something to offer. I enjoyed the last 5-6 episodes. HOTD is not as great as GOT, at least up till now. The whole first season is like an introduction/preamble though. Next seasons will be more intense, i am sure.4) In conclusion, Game of Thrones it is not. And that's ok, GOT is at least top 5 tv series ever. HOTD is promising. This was a good beginning. Let's see what future holds."
"Whether its sex, violence, or some other over-the-top scenario, most series have their first episode geared towards grabbing the viewer's attention and not letting go. This one was written like the producers were half way through the second season and undecided whether or not to continue on for season three. It was boring and I struggled to stay interested. Just like GOT, the dragons only have brief cameos and serve more as background dressing."
"After the first 2 episodes I still had good hopes, but eps 3&4 killed it for me. I decided not to watch any further.They tried hard to create the look and feel of GoT, but eventhough some characters are decent, most actors are not unique or interesting to me. I find the dialogs between the actors poor. The music and sound effects are also poor and some instances misplaced.I do not sense any mystery, religious mysticism, magic feeling or the epic quests that GoT had to offer. The poor quality of eps 3 & 4 do not interest me to wait it out any longer. Too many scenes are dragged out and made boring."
"A good start to a prequel. 172 Years before Danny (Please do not ask about Danny's cameo :P)So much build up to the Dornish Cristen Cole. But he never made any impact. Looks dull too. Rhaenyra Targaryen doesn't look like someone who is going to compete for the throne. She looks weak and uninterested to act. But through high recommendation she was casted for that role. Dracarys is such a powerful word. When Danny says it, I get goosebumps regardless how much ever time I watch it. But when Rhaenyra said, I was vomiting literally. This is what happens when you recruit through recommendation.I'm already in love with Alicent HighTower.Casting is the main issue in this series."
"I don't understand all the hate. I really likes this first episode. Yes, it was a bit slow paced, but honestly I watched shows that started much slower and I had to start the first episode 3-4 times to get me hooked. It's not the case with House of the Dragon.1. The wigs could be better, but it isn't so bad as to distract me.2. I like that they started with fewer characters, because I get to remember them further on.3. I liked the attention to details, for example the instances where the king gets cut a lot on the iron throne, and as you remember from GOT, it was a sign that someone was not fit to be a ruler.4. I saw that many people didn't like the acting, and honestly I can't understand why. I liked every character I saw. Alicent Hightower gave me the impression that she knows more than she lets on. Daemon doesn't seem bad, maybe only a trouble maker, time will tell. I also liked Ser Harrold Westerling, but perhaps I am biased because I know Graham McTavish from Outlander and he is a very good actor.Overall, I liked the first episode and I have high hopes for the next ones. I hope they don't ruin it and that it will be a long and catchy show."
"The 10s on this show are a bit over zealous, but I can't blame them really with all the sludge being pumped out the pipeline from Marvel / Amazon etc. It does start to look like a 10 in a sea of 1,2, and 3s.I much prefer good story to pointless action, but even then it can be a bit slow an meander at times early on. It is however getting better each week thus far which I appreciate. It is very nice to have some actual good characters that you can be excited to tune in and see in a television show.The after-credit shorts with the show runners have been the worst part of the show, strongly recommend turning it off directly after the show ends.Even some of the characters with personalities that tend towards the annoying actually have a point, the princess who comes off as obnoxious you begin to realize is really just spoiled because of who she is.Trending upward, hope it keeps its momentum - looking ahead to more episodes."
"Good start, I'm engaged and looking forward to the next episode. The writing is solid, much better than the jr. College crap that's in Rings of Power. Hey Amazon, maybe you can poach the writing room from this show to fix that train wreck you have going on. Or maybe they could get some ideas about: pacing, character introductions, story arc and how to use exposition.These characters are engaging; I want to get to now them better. I am curious how far Hightower will push his daughter to get with the king. The jousting was brutal and seemed genuine. Much better than the troll fighting scen where Galadriel Mary-sued her way to effortless victory.Once again, this show is much more engaging that Rings of Power. If you only have room for one fantasy show, House of Dragons is your better bet."
"After the disappointing end to Got I did not expect anything from the House of the Dragon, but it lives up to the great writing and direction seen in the early GoT seasons.I highly recommend it both to the fans of Got but to anyone else who have not seen it as well. The prequel stands on its own and I hope it will continue for many years with the same quality.The characters are well developed, the story line is intriguing and captivating. The quality of production really shows. The persons responsible for the casting also did an amazing job. The SGI is great.To sum it up do not miss seeing House of the Dragon."
"Fulfill fully the expectation. Game of Thrones still remains in our mind & heart...Now House of the Dragon comes to create another history First episode was a blast and day by day, episode by episode it just got better. Dragons, Drogons anything we call. It's awesome,must watch.Fulfill fully the expectation.

Game of Thrones still remains in our mind & heart...Now House of the Dragon comes to create another history First episode was a blast and day by day, episode by episode it just got better. Dragons, Drogons anything we call. It's awesome,must watch."
"The production quality is flawless, the actors are great, everything just visually is great.However there is a time skip between every episode and the story feels very disconnected and jumpy.The episodes can end on what feels like a cliffhanger and yet it's never really brought up in the next episode, instead we're two years in the future and whatever happened back then has already been resolved.Liking this type of storytelling sure is individual and it will certainly please some people, I however greatly dislike it. Maybe it all will be worth it in the end or maybe the story is building up to a more continuous arc, but so far it's less than great."
"House of the Dragon has certainly dispelled any misgivings I had about it after the disaster that was Game of Thrones' final season. It carried a similar feel to Game of Thrones' initial seasons, but darker. You certainly know that you're back in that same universe as Dany and Tyrion etc.The only aspect I enjoyed in GoT and have missed in this show so far (perhaps it will change but unlikely) is the absence of humour. Wit and humour from the likes of Tyrion were essential to balancing out the otherwise serious tone of that show. I wish there was some wit here. Perhaps a court fool would suffice.Regardless, this looks to be a strong and worthy successor to GoT thus far and if you loved GoT, you'll love HotD. *hehe*"
"The series was good up to the halfway mark when Emma D'Arcy took over as Rhaenyra and then it just DIED. Became simply a boring woe-mance, with the odd dragon flying around occasionally.Casting two different actresses for the ten years later thing was a BRAINDEAD move. They should have simply had Milly Alcock play Rhaenyra all the way through, since she is clearly such a vastly superior actress and far more interesting to watch than Emma D'Arcy. It REALLY throws the viewer when they're CLEARLY looking at a totally different person playing the same character, when many of the other characters apparently look totally the same as they did before.Show is barely worth watching, if anything worthwhile up to the halfway mark for Milly Alcock's portion. Similar to Game of Thrones, with the advantage that it doesn't wait 8 seasons to turn into a letdown..."
"The special effects are great, as well as the stunts and wardrobe, and all... but the characters are terribly basic and predictable. Quite disappointing, but just follows the writing of the last season of GoT...And they killed it all off by deciding to change the actresses, terrible decision!! Why are Milly Alcock's and Emily Carey's characters the only ones to age differently?In sum, it's a very American series, made to be easy on the eyes and even easier on the mind. Don't think too much about it, or you'll see that there's a lot that doesn't make sense, just let yourself be dazzled by all the fake stuff, the pretty robes and special effects."
"I never thought I'd be writing this after the travesty that was GOT Season 8 but wow ; house of the dragon has taken me back to the early days when I first started watching GOT. I never read the books so watching this series felt like a new world to explore again. The characters are refreshing , the references to GOT nostalgic and the actors are simply lovely in terms of their acting and all their chemistry.The chemistry between Daemon and Rhaenarys as messed up as it sounds is beautifully adapted by both their actors. The King perfectly embodies the sense of duty and misery. The show is refreshing , has a solid storyline and has the potential to be greater than GOT. A solid foundation coupled with a visionary writing team will make House of The Dragon a prodigy. Keep in mind , this review was written by episode 4 and I've not had the guts to skip even 1 second of any episode cause the story has been thrilling so far."
"After watching the second episode, the show is starting off slow. It doesn't have to be a problem, and it is fitting, as it allows the viewer to reminisce and savor the spaces and similar scenes that were so iconic in the sequel of the franchise. But, sadly, it is beging to unveil that this isn't so much a deliberate choice as much as it is a frugality to be able to afford detailed crafted scenes with artistic intentions It seems somehow like that duality isn't comensurate - it's like two different shows.For now it is good to have some more content of the franchise but it seems that the show is much more insipid and empty (hiding behind stylized scenes and dragon cgi) without story and characters to intensify the show. The characters are plain and the show is not looking to stand on its own, but instead to find new ways to try and do what GoT already achieved with brutal and sadistic displays of violence, sex and fantasy cgi.It may be soon to judge the show, but for now it is more like a taste for the GoT hardcore fans to saciate their hunger. Because the show seems too passive, much less focused and directed towards showcasing the setting again from a polished light instead of aiming to tell a story that stands on its own.It's also relatively sad, even if tolerable, that the show tries to advance multiculturalism purposefully while neglecting to make a world that is convincing to the respective older age. We see a world that is technologically similar, and not much has changed.In all honestly, I didn't read the books to attest how close it is to the orignial material, but from a logical standpoint, the world we should be seing should be more apropriate to the older age.Nevertheless, it is still enjoyable to see a new council with new problems being discussed and solved, letting us peer into the medieval mentality and problematics.I liked GoT mostly for the power games and political maneuvers and this show is focusing more on this aspect and not on action which they reserve only for dragon galore. I don't dislike this. It is fitting. The Targaeryans may not be the most insteresting house but they probably have the most lore and theatrical value (considering they have dragons) to stand for their own focused show.I'm just glad there are not white walkers and zombies for now.All in all, the show may not be as good but it can be enjoyable if you approach it as a peek into the world again. We might as well enjoy it and not have too many expectations."
"To be perfectly honest, I was not sold after the first episode. The pacing felt way too fast, the characters felt explained rather than explored and it did not feel as grand as the GoT. Of course the first episode was far from bad but not as good as it could have been.However by episode 3 the world has been introduced, new characters have been introduced and explored in a very good way. The world is slowly building itself, the acting is also improving and the house of the dragon is showing all the signs of becoming a great show.I do hope that this show will continue to improve in the coming episodes because I am very excited to see where this show will take us viewers in the future."
Everything is just epic finally something will keep us entertained and excited i like you HBO for producing this masterpiece same time i hate you for cutting rised by wolves.
"Rating: Unratable MasterpiecePrepare to be enthralled and swept away by the epic fantasy saga that is House of the Dragon! As a devoted fan of the Game of Thrones universe, I can confidently say that this new installment has exceeded all expectations and redefined what it means to craft a truly captivating television series.The creators of House of the Dragon have gifted us with an unparalleled journey into the rich history of Westeros, bringing to life the Targaryen dynasty like never before. The visuals are breathtaking, and the attention to detail is simply awe-inspiring. From the ornate costumes to the stunning dragon CGI, every aspect of this show is a testament to the dedication and craftsmanship of the production team.But it's not just the visuals that make House of the Dragon a must-watch; it's the extraordinary storytelling that truly sets it apart. The intricate and unpredictable plotlines keep viewers on the edge of their seats, making it nearly impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. Political intrigue, family drama, and intense battles become the building blocks of this mesmerizing narrative.One of the standout elements of the series is undoubtedly the impeccable cast. Each actor effortlessly embodies their respective characters, bringing nuance and depth to their roles. The Targaryens are portrayed with such raw emotion and authenticity that you can't help but be emotionally invested in their triumphs and tragedies.Moreover, House of the Dragon skillfully addresses relevant themes, reflecting the complexities of power, loyalty, and the consequences of choices. The characters' development and growth are brilliantly woven into the storyline, providing the audience with an emotionally charged connection to the world of Westeros.Furthermore, the showrunners have managed to strike the perfect balance between paying homage to the original Game of Thrones series and carving out a unique identity for House of the Dragon. While familiar elements are present, the prequel firmly stands on its own as a powerhouse of storytelling.In conclusion, giving House of the Dragon a mere star rating would be a gross injustice to this unratable masterpiece. It's a symphony of intrigue, emotions, and cinematic brilliance that sets a new benchmark for television excellence. Brace yourself for an unforgettable journey through the captivating world of dragons, ambition, and legacy. This series will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on all who dare to enter its scorching flames!"
"I was fan of characters from GOT and saw their evolution during 10 Seasons and I had really enjoy it.HOD is in the same world and I start to enjoy some characters and looking forward how will evolve main characters and plots.I think we should not compare GOT and HOD , its different time and diffeents characters. Try to see common plots is for me useless and waste time, i think we should focus on this new storie in the Westeros world.For now, i saw, like everyone, 2 episodes and its very promising and we're starting to see dramatic plots and the storylines build.Let finish the 1st Season and will really know if we can wait for the Season 2 :-p."
"All Tolkien fanatics might understand and be immersed more easily into the story, but I find it amazingly dull and repetitive. Some of you praise it. Why? None of the characters are engaging and the plot so far is glued to who will be next in line, they shouldn't be next in line, I should be next in line...repetitive. High production value and little creativity. Winter has come once again, creatively speaking. Feels like a money grab for HBO MAX to hook subscribers that mourn GoT. Not really worth the time but I'll keep watching and sleeping to it. The best character is the a-hole uncle of the princess...and he's not even likable or somewhat interesting."
As grandeur as GoT which I did not expect and first episode made the impact and gave goosebumps... worth the wait... feels like another series to look forward to just as I used to for GoT.
"5 Stars are for the production and visuals, the 6st Star is for this being GOT (even if it pales in comparison with the Original Series). Ye its pretty Bland and Basic in what comes to plot-twists and turns in the argument (they are barely even unexisting), also not enough interesting or memorable characters and moments. Some episodes I swear they throw a Dragon Flying so that the show doesnt get too boring or uninteresting. The main issue really is the wooden and linear story that just isn't interesting enough, which is the antithesis of the original show. Should I recomend this if your a fan of GOT? Yes, just don't get your hopes too high or you'll be tremendously disapointed."
"1, actors are poor looking. I don't see one beautiful person that makes sense to the book's description.2, barely any story telling or character building. Can't feel anything towards any character. They come, they die. The End. Thank you for watching.3, it's so dark it hurts my eyes. Don't really know why the entire show is shot so dark, as if they are all in a cave.I don't get the high rating of the show. Maybe a lot of nostalgic book fans or GoT fans. To me, it's just like a bored teacher reading a book to students with no enthusiasm and missed a lot of lines because he needs to clock in and go home."
"I knew when this show was announced that it would be good. But I did not at all think it could be on the same level as Game Of Thrones. So many great characters, so many great performances and so many epic moments. After watching all the episode, I can only say we finally after many years have a show we can call incredible. Emma and Milly do a great job playing Rhaenyra. Olivia outshines Emily as Alicent a tiny bit. And the rest of the crew are perfect. Dragons are also super dope and not constantly in the background for no reason, they play an important part and only appear when it's necessary. Overall, this first season is brilliant and I am looking forward to the next one."
"A great show nonetheless, the ending of Game of Thrones left so many of us rendering helpless, yet HBO found redemption, through this show, which seems to follow the same path of success as that of GOT, FIRE, AND BLOOD, for so many Ashes shall drape the great realm, and rivers of blood shall curse the seven kingdom's true self. Yet Mayhem shall be deemed admirable, and peace seen as an abomination."
"When HOTD was first announced, I had doubts as to whether it would be good. But after watching the first episode... I am blown away. From the acting to the set design.If they maintains the quality and intrigue of episode one, HOTD could be better than GOT."
"The show is going great, I see many fanboys crying because there is very less action in this seriesðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. This seires is more story driven, I saw some idiots complaining about the lighting of this episode, some haters even said that it was worse than THE NIGHT KING fight at winterfellðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Some said they could not a damn thing, well for them I would suggest to get their eyes checked, everything was clearly visible. And there are many haters who are saying GoT season 8 was better than the whole House of the Dragon. I have one question for them, are you all high? Many fanboys are still disappointed by the last season of GoT that is why they are hating this show. It's a great show, everyone should watch it except the haters."
"Intrigue, political games, backstabbing. I expected nothing less from House of The Dragon which you can tell a lot just by its name alone. The first season seemed a bit rushed but it certainly didn't disappoint. The acting was very good and was definitely one of the most memorable things as was the directing. The action is at a satisfactory level for a first season as the show is building up yet and I think it has a lot more to show so we shouldn't rush to judge and wait to see the final result. Personally, I'm looking forward to see what they have in mind for season two and I have very high hopes for the show's future. Btw Matt Smith is awesome as Daemon Targaryen and my favorite characterðŸ”¥"
"It can't be praised enough that it was accomplished to produce such a superb and unique spin-off after a TV sensation like GOT. Although this series is obviously set in the same universe and the GOT flavour is recognisable, it still possesses a distinct atmosphere. The characters are hugely interesting and often even more complex (possibly also due to the fact that the HOD world is simply much smaller so far) The first season does start off relatively slowly but ends bombastically, leaving the spectators craving for more. My only genuine criticism would be that there are quite a few plot leaps in the second half of the season that disrupt the otherwise smooth character development and flow of events."
"In episode 6, a woman who is 9 months pregnant races her husband on a dragon. You see, when you try to present a story as dark, serious, and mature, a scene this cartoonish simply takes you out of the experience completely. Makes you wonder how serious the writers are about the plot.There isn't a single character that hooks you in. Many of the characters just aren't convincing. Kind of hard to follow a medieval series that has characters who are just obviously from 2022 with some goofy costumes on.From the way many of the dialogues are carried out to even the way folks look. Something is just missing, and that's okay ... it's probably a difficult thing to pull off. I will say that the King's hand Hightower is easily the most convincing character, but that's where it ends.Production quality is top-tier but it doesn't mean anything if you can't resonate with the viewers. The plot is a whole lot of nothing, which wouldn't be so bad if the side dialogue was intriguing like in GOT.At the end of the day, I'm clearly in the minority here judging by the average user scores. After watching the likes of Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, GOT 1-7, Deadwood, and other high quality series, I have very high standards and my spidey senses for mediocrity are superb. I really don't have time for anything but the best of the best. I had hoped HOD would get the job done, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.Edit after season one finale:It actually gets quite good and characters become a little more believable. Still missing something in my opinion. Production quality is really insane, better than GOT. Sadly, the dialogue isn't quite there."
"I know it's just one episode so far, but this show is lacking big time. The show gave the viewers nothing to look forward to in the season. Plus the actors are subpar... especially the actress that plays the princess. Could the producers not find a prettier girl and one that could act to play the part? Not sure about these high reviews. It makes no sense. They must have carried over from GOT. It is just a show using the GOT's name to make money. It's all about money. Watch it for yourself, but don't expect much."
"I waited for years after the disastrous S8 of GOT..Now it comes, and I actually go back and re-watch the S1E1 of GOT and did a comparison...GOT S1E1 - starts with the wall and the gate (impressive), and the little platoon ran into the death and corpse. Leads to the white walker and immediately one is hooked.HOD S1E1 - Starts with the dragon and then a platoon scared and ready to fight the dragon (something about to start,...), then a little girl jump off. Nothing happened, just a dragon ride....There sums perfectly of the difference of the two. HOD basically is saying I am related to GOT,, see Dragon Dragon and ordinary people are afraid of dragon and the girl is not!.. Forgot about the story or anything else and come see me because I have dragon and I am GOT!So there you go... Quality vs living in the shadow of that quality..Remember how S8 ended with that battle? The ""subvert of expectation"" was to see our main character one by one about to die and then oh he/she lives over and over? That's a sign when there is no real story/material so Dumb and Dumber just go with the cheapest subvert your expectation possible.. And here in HOD the first 1 min you experienced the same.. Ohhh they are fighting the dragon.. oh they are not it's just a little girl....Without the talent of writing all what's left are cheap thrills.. I cancelled my MAX after the first episode."
"When HOD first came out, I was so excited because GOT is like a drug for me and I've been craving it since that fiasco of a final episode. And then week after week of first episodes I got a bit more disappointed because I was comparing it to the original and couldn't quite get satisfied of what I'm seeing. It had the same feel as GOT but at the same time it wasn't what I expected to see.Then by episode 6 I realized that I'm thinking about this show way more and get way more excited about new episodes. Like developing a new addiction.And after watching episode 8 I finally realized that even though this show has the same quality, costumes and decorations, even music as GOT, it's not GOT at all. It's a completely different show, just set in the same world. And it's awesome, and deserves all the attention it gets and more but as the ORIGINAL SHOW. And I personally feel so lucky that we get to live through it again... In a different form. But just as addictive."
I liked the presentation of the characters. It was an interesting episode. I can't wait for the rest of the events. I hope some people don't make criticisms that have no meaning. Be positive.
"Clearly the people writing reviews are people who haven't actually watched the series, probably those who think they are 'cool' because they're in the minority who haven't watched GoT before ha. Ignore the written reviews, the overall series review score speaks volumes.Fantastic acting from all of the cast, they've uncovered a new diamond in Alcock, the show is suspenseful, full of tension and like with GoT you become invested in the characters. There hasn't been many 'action' scenes so far so maybe that's why some are saying it's 'boring' but if you have a bit more about you and can appreciate a good storyline then you won't go wrong watching this show!"
"It's an amazing show, if GoT had not come before it, I double there would be as many negative reviews. The graphics, the story etc all align with the books. I love how they filled in the elusive parts. This is not GoT, but what you think of it says a lot about your personality. If you are critical you will hate it, if you love a good fantasy story, you will love it. There are too many characters to develop character in one story, hence why Game of Thrones was chosen first to represent these books. How any of you can hate something written so close to it's author is beyond me. Laenor and Laena at least get a glorious ending in this version. Alicent is much more likable here."
"1st episode of the #HouseoftheDragon was lit, its far better than the 1st episode of #GameOfThrones. #DaemonTargaryen fits perfectly as I imagined, loved his role in this episode. Hope entire season will be like this. That GoT theme, old days.More politics, more brutal, more blod & more n*des than GoT. Loving it"
#HouseOfTheDragonHBO.
"Great start, One of the most beautiful and powerful beginnings in history. I loved very much preserving the legacy, The most important thing they had to do was preserve Game of Thrones and they did it successful. The show was able to remind Game of Thrones almost in every moments. The dialogues were very beautiful, the characters we got to know some of the characters and all of them were beautiful, and the beautiful thing is that they gave each character their time from the episode. The soundtrack is awesome. The designs are very beautiful. Dragons are legendary.The first episode is beautiful waiting for the rest."
"Production wise it's on par. Although so far the locations have been sparse, you can see the budget is there.However, the story is very much lacking any intrigue.By the end of the first GoT episode, there were already 4 intrigues unfolding:"
"The white walkers seemed to be back (and winter's coming)The hand of the king is dead, apparently murdered by the Lannisters, and the king is coming to demand Ned to become the new hand (against Ned's wishes, but he is a duty bound man)Daenarys gets married to Drogo, and her brother plots to overthrow Westeros with an army of DothrakiJaemie pushes Bran to his apparent death, after Bran discovers Jaemie's incestuous relationship with his sister, the queen.Next to that it had a bunch of interesting scenes: the execution of the deserter, any scene with Tyrion, finding the dire wolf whelps, Arya being a little brat to her brother and sister to the amusement of her older brothers, the greetings when the king arrives in Winterfell.In contrast House of the Dragon offers very little. There is only one ""intrigue"" if we can even call it that, because from the start it's played very openly, and that's the throne succession.The casting director is also not Nina Gold, who did so for GoT, and you can clearly feel the difference. Where GoT had you fall head over heels with half the cast, HotD struggles hard.It's never just the casting director alone though. If the script, and by extension the source material did not provide enough depth to these characters, casting them is all the more difficult. Either you take seasoned actors who can fill in the blanks themselves, or you risk the chance of having cardboard cutouts on screen. HotD suffers from too many shallow characters.While after the first episode in GoT, you could already tell the character and aspirations of a lot of the cast (Arya was the bratty tomboy, Ned is all honor and duty, Sansa is still a silly girl dreaming of being a princess while her mother sighs at her naivety, Tyrion is a wisecracking whoring drunk who wears his dwarfism as an armor against all insult, Snow knows that as a bastard he doesn't belong and is looking to move out (maybe to the Wall), the king also a whoring drunkard and knows that he can only trust Ned.)"
"HotD left me wondering what the character and aspirations of its characters are. If you ask me who the princess is or what her drivers are, I would have to pass on the question, because after two episodes, I have no idea, and she's supposed to be center stage. Weirdly enough she gets a lot of screentime, but the scenes bog down into uninteresting and unrevealing conversations about any of its main characters.Where GoT explored the aspirations of its characters future selves, HotD is happy to settle for scrutinizing their feelings in the moment.Although it has more dragons, HotD will never soar higher than GoT (and yes, I'm ignoring those last 2 seasons, especially the last horrid one...)"
"I must say I didn't had that much expectations after how the last few seasons of game of thrones went by but the pilot episode gives the vibes of thrones first few seasons when books material was being used. I can see people having difficult time choosing their favourite character as well because the characters seems much more complicated than good vs bad like in thrones , we had Starks who were mostly good and Lannisters somewhat bad. But here things are quite different, looking forward for how the rest of the season unfurls."
I'm reluctant to rate any show only three episodes into it but I doubt that my rating will change unless some more interesting things happen later. So far only three or four major characters have been introduced. All the others are court hangers-on trying to gain some favor from a wimpy king who is afraid of being outplayed by his headstrong brother. In the first episode of GOT a dozen or so major characters were introduced. As the series progressed several dozen others appears. All of them were interesting and well drawn and most were played by seasoned actors. This show is way too dark. Whoever was responsible for the cinematography should have his license revoked.Update after episode 4. Things starting to come together. Events regarding the Princess came as a complete surprise. (Sarcasm alert.) Still at a 7 but trending lower.Update after episode 5. This keeps getting worse and worse.
"After three episodes the plot is a circular, repetitious soap like focus on a few members of the royal family. Follows a set formula of father (the king) talks to his daughter and upsets her, father talks to daughters friend, father talks to advisors then talks to his daughter and upsets her again.Probably aimed more at a teen demographic than the original. The one battle scene so far was more like something out of a Marvel production where a single hero runs into an army and they are nice enough to only attack him one at a time so that he can do some dance moves to defeat them. Very unlike the gritty battle scenes from the original."
"Based on the first 2 episodes...poor casting choices. Paddy Considine Is such a one-note schlub who would have easily been taken out long before due to some palace intrigue. Matt Smith is too famous and recognizable for his role. Has the UK and Ireland run out of actors? What made Game of Thrones so interesting is that we didn't know most of the leads and therefore were able to immerse ourselves in that world easier. Putting familiar actors in costume and historical series pull us out of the story too easily (eg. Ed Sheeren in GOT). The series does look amazing (except for a few of the long shot vistas) and has set up some good palace intrigue, however familiar. The jousting games were splendidly filmed and exciting and the costumes are amazing. Familiar GOT characters (like the hand of the king) help us quickly become familiar with this world and there are references to families we already know which also help draw us in. However, poor casting and a couple of supporting actors' acting skills are jarring."
"After years i'm very happy to be at got's universe again, i don't know if it has triggered my nostalgic feelings but i feel so good while watching even seeing this universe i watched 2 times single episode, even i miss waiting for new episodes."
"This show has great characters, acting, writing, tension, story, sets and dragons. I do prefer the more sprawling story of Game of Thrones and the interweaving stories of the different royal houses, however, the more focused inter-familial story with House of the Dragon gives a nice change and I've enjoyed every minute thus far. Game of Thrones was your epic, sprawling fantasy whereas House of the Dragon reminds me little of The Godfather.As a side note, authors that either used the current state of the world around them and their personal experiences (such as Tolkien) or use actual real medieval history and their rules of the time as influence (such as Martin), shouldn't have to have their stories changed to fit the current political views and societal beliefs of our modern world. They should be adapted as faithfully as possible and taken for what it is. Don't tamper with art. I might not agree with certain things from the past and how things were done but we can't just ignore history either. House of the Dragon actually stays very close to the source material unlike Rings of Power, where they really should have taken LOTR out of the title and called it something else.Can't wait to see the rest of the season! Superior to Rings of Power in every way!"
"Watching House of the Dragon is like eating your favourite food, only that it's from yesterday. It's not fresh, not original, but you still like it. So far it does not have the compelling characters of GoT had (I miss you, Lord Varys) with the possible exception of Daemon Targaryen, but overall the characters are good and the plot is intriguing enough. I just wish they had switched the casting for King Viserys ans Otto Hightower. And explained to the viewers who that Crabfeeder guy was and what he wanted! I am looking forward to watch how the plot will evolve, there is some nasty staff in the novel and incest is surprisingly not the worst of it. Let's see how they deal with it!"
"Let's be clear from the start, this isn't action packed but that doesn't mean nothing is happening. I'd say it's very similar to the early seasons of GoT. It's very much about the politics of Kings Landing and the line of succession to the throne. It's building to something slowly which is what I loved about early GoT.My only criticism would be the time shift mid season. While necessary to live the story forward, it was disappointing to leave those versions of the characters behind.I don't agree with some critical that the budget seems to drop off mid season, there's nothing to back that up. If anything I'd suggest it's quite the opposite.It also sets up an explosive season 2 very nicely."
"Another spin off series to add to the pile, but how does it measure up?(pretty well) We all know that this is a Game of Thrones spinoff, and it wears that on it's sleeve, its just as much of a character drama as Game of Thrones with some spectacle and battles sprinkled in. Set about 200 years before the events of GoT and no prior knowledge of the show and the universe is required.The Good:"
"The visuals and effects are pretty great, the world is beautiful and immersive as hell, you are sucked in as soon as the show begins.The music is spot on, they used the same composer as the one who did GoT, and it shows, because they clearly know how to sell a scene.The characters are very compelling, no one seems like some perfect being or a complete idiot, they all have their own motivations.The story is tight knit and very eventful, things are always happening, the world continues to unravel as the show goes on, with unexpected twists here and there. I'm glad to say that they clearly took the finale of GoT to heart and are sticking closer to the source material, the world is so captivating and alive, you learn about the different houses and kingdoms and their political imbalances and struggles.The Bad:"
"There is a LOT of time skips, the show moves so fast that they have to switch some actors to keep up with the jumps in age. This can be jarring, but it's kind of necessary to set the scene of the show and keep the pacing up to scruff.This is a GoT spinoff, if you didn't like that, you definitely won't like this. It is through and through, a character and political drama.You are bound to dislike a/some character(s) in this show, everyone has questionable morals, and it's probably going to annoy some people.It does not reach the highs of GoT season 1Final Thoughts:"
"This show was definitely not perfect, but as a spinoff to one of the most critically acclaimed shows of all time(minus s8), it can reach those highs if it keeps going in the same trajectory. Am definitely excited for a season 2."
"Simply put this show goes to great lengths to hide the low budget HBO applied and it's obvious. The problem boils down to the word ""exposition"" and you'll fall asleep being subjected to it repeatedly. The old saying is ""show it, don't say it"" and that will ring in your mind as you sit through endless discussions around the king's table as they describe situations that the original GOT would have ACTUALLY SHOWN! Don't get me wrong a great show can be made on a low budget but the attempt here is frankly boring. There are very few ""edge of your seat"" moments nor intriguing plotlines to bring you back each episode. Instead the writers try the same old tired tricks from the original on occasion; hoping to keep you interested. (gore, incest, etc.) yet these moments feel contrived and viewer-baiting."
"In the next episode all the young actors including the princess included will be replaced by older actors ; since the show will jump time . But thank god that didn't affect matt smith who is for me the only reason to watch the show . The pace is very slow. God i miss Cercei!!!Let's pray for a future kinda of red wedding . Cause sometimes the dialogues and lack of action makes it boring .Also can we see more of the dragons , we re in the targaryen world for god sake's !!!!Also why there are not fights yet? All the 4 episodes were about whos gong to inherit the throne . Ok we get it . Can we move past that ?? I miss succession as well !!!!!!!"
"This is visually beautiful, but empty to the story and characters. First, I do not understand why was chosen this part of GoT world for a spin off. I would be much more interested how the Targaryens got to have dragons than this...Second, all the characters are appearing and disappearing at the same time. There is no time to develop any kind of sympathy or antipathy against them. Not interesting plot. It's shallow and feels weird to watch. It's almost like HBO rehired Dumb&Dumber again... And that recasting? What is that for? I mean, new actors are just fine in their roles, but why? Why there is a change in Rhaenyra, Laena, Alicent and Laenor and Ser Criston Cole remains same? I mean Robert DeNiro can play same character through all age in The Irishman and here is the problem with 10 years gap? I continue to watch just because of the nostalgy to the original series, but I am deeply disappointed."
"Yes, boring. I am surprised though at even many who diss if for being boring, give it high marks for production values. The CGI and movement of say a dear on a hunt, are ridiculously low value to me, and I'm no CGI corksniffer, not a high bar for me but this was bad. Also the look of it. Mist, smoke, outside most shots are obscured, gray, dismal, but also I wonder, probably a lot cheaper to render, did they save money on that?Inside, I notice a LOT of back lighting, which is not very pleasing to the eye, or even normal camera work. Light through windows fairly blinds one to the faces of the characters inside. Though really, it doesn't matter much because this faces aren't emoting anything particularly interesting.They hash, then rehash, then re rehash, then again, the same themes. Some say this is the political aspect, but I enjoy political intrigue and this isn't it. They seem to be using a thesaurus to have the characters say the same things over and over. No intrigue, or not much. A king that is wish washy, not very effective and seems unable to grasp the reality around him, pouty princess who I think they are trying to show as brave and fearless, yet mainly I see just pouty. Kings brother is a menacing bad boy, except...it's a little burlesque, overdone. Making the king even seem more obtuse for not seeing what is so overdone and clear. I don't think these are spoilers, but clicked on yes in case.Story so far, I've watched up to and including episode 3, and I'm not sure how much more I can take. Went into it rooting for it to be a good story. Now my wife and I watch it when we run out of series we like episodes. And almost have to egg each other on to watch it.It's bad. Badly written, badly acted, bad production, and it's boring. Maybe it will get better? It can't get worse."
"I may be one of the few watchers who loved the ending of Game of Thrones. There was no other way to sign off of Westeros and Daenerys' increasing warped sense of destiny. And there couldn't be a better beginning (prequel) to GOT than Episode one of House of Dragon. Characters are intriguing, acting is masterful, special effects were not horrible (yet not great). Yep, I'll be watching every week."
"Back when GoT came out, I was looking forward more to the Borgias and saw GoT as a side dish to just check out. I didn't expect much.How things have changed! Despite the well-known disappointment of Game of Thrones last season(s), I was looking forward to this a lot. The source material is finished and they had likely learned from their mistakes.I absolutely love this! There's intrigue, many more dragons, Matt Smith and a ton of other great actors.But yes, Matt Smith and his character are stealing the show. They've already treated us with a battle.The one thing I'm not enthusiastic about is Otto Hightower. People call him a mix between Tywin and Little Finger, but both those characters entertained me. Otto hasn't done that yet."
This show is simply a masterpiece. I loved it from the first to the last minute. It's fresh but yet nostalgic. It has some Game of Thrones vibes for sure but the characters seem to be morally grey. There are no Joffreys to hate or Jon Snos to love. Everyone can be loved and hated at the same time.The soundtrack is a true masterpiece. Ramin did it again. The actors and actresses are so talented and fitted to their roles. Good job HBO.
"Awesome Cinematography. CGI looks really good. NOT overtly woke &/or preachy. That being said, the acting is more of a mixed bag. Milly Alcock, as young Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, comes across as being wooden at best. Nevertheless, Paddy Considine as Viserys I is quite convincing. Matt Smith is his usual self. No issue there. My biggest issue however is with the overarching storyline, which shares the same nihilistic trope of 'subversion' with the now (in)famous OG series.Don't know how long will it keep the audience engaged, at least those who know how it all ends.P. S. Having low expectations will enhance the viewing experience. Lol."
"Just finished the first episode and yeah, i think I'm gonna like this show. This world feels so authentic to the one portrayed in martins work. My only complaint is a lack of opening theme song, game of thrones had one of the most iconic themes of all time. Maybe the first episode was just a cold open and we can expect one for episode 2? Fingers crossed."
"I loved it! While I loved Game of Thrones, the first episode was hard to get through for me. I didn't have that problem here. I'm already captivated by the characters and their relationships and I can't wait to see how this show messes those relationships up ðŸ˜‚"
"After 1 episode, it's not a 10 but certainly not a 1. I was afraid it'd be yet another woke abortion of a series but then I remembered it's by HBO, not Netflix. I think it's a decent start and I'll certainly be watching more."
"If you are a fan of GOT, then this is for you. I've seen some reviews here talking about ""something is missing"", this is a season 1, don't rush, wait for the story to settle down a little. It is getting built up, the characters are revealing their characteristics, don't just jump to conclusions yet. There is still a lot to come.It's 31st of Aug and 2 episodes are released, these 2 episodes will let you know how well this is written, directed and acted. For me, this is Game of Thrones. And please, don't compare Books with TV series. There is always a difference, both have different audiences. People got to understand that."
"That Viserys crown scene in episode 8 was great. The girl power dragon scene in episode 9 was horrible.Generally speaking, the plotting was much worse and more basic than the first 4 seasons of Game of Thrones.Like that fight at the wedding or the fight between the kids with the stabbed out eye. That was very basic. The Littlefinger plots were much better and well thought out.And Viserys was not as interesting a character as the father in Succession. He just tried to keep the peace. That was a bit one-note in comparison to the cool and badass patriarch of Succession.What is it with all those birth scenes? Do we really need to see a new bloody birth scene in every second episode?The dragons are cool. So was the dragon fight in the last episode. Daemon is cool, too.I loved the map table.The first episodes were too slow.This season has not been as good as it could have been. The problem is that George does not have script approval. And the writers of this season simply don't seem to care as much for his story as he does. It's not as intricate. The details don't work as well as when he himself writes it. If HBO is clever, they should give him script approval for everything!"
The 1st 5 episodes were great... The character changes at episode 6 ruined everything. Replacing Milly Alcock was the death of the show and now it is almost unwatchable. The show replaced the 2 best cast members because it jumped ahead 10 years but the other cast members were ok to keep? Episode 6 was very boring and not enjoyable to watch. The only way to save this show will require the remainder of the season to be a flash back to 10 years ago and use the original cast it started with. I have never been so let down by a show and have no interest in watching it anymore. Don't waste your time watching this.
"If it's any close to the first season up until fifth season of Game of Thrones, then it's going to be really good!Writing seems great, not as the ""last"" season shÃ®t show of GoT where they betrayed the characters in question. Hopefully this will not happen again since it ended up me being done with Game of Thrones. I want to love this universe. I'm intrigued!"
"The show looks great. The actors all fit superbly in their roles, especially the main trio of Targaryens (Viserys, Daemon and Rhaenyra). I also think Corlys' new look was a smart choice as he's essentially a Targaryen look-alike in the book which probably would have confused the tv-only audience of the show. The actor is great besides.The dialogue feels more Westerosi than ever! Great little GRRM-isms have found their way into the script which in a way makes the world feel even more like ASOIF than the original Game of Thrones show. This is surprising considering the book (Fire and blood) which the show is based on doesn't contain that much dialogue. Kudos to showrunner Ryan Condal who clearly is a great student+fan of Martin's books. He was also handpicked by Martin himself for this project and it's now clear why.So far the show delivers on the intrigue and politicking of GoT, but has not yet delivered on the action sequences which its predecessor so excelled at. If it manages that in the episodes to come it's a 10 for me."
"So basically what I see in all reviews is either people who can't get over how bad the last GOT season was (people who rate it 1/10) or people who actually care about what to recommend (people who rate it 2/10-10/10).The start is definitely not a 10/10 but damn it's definitely not a 1/10, there are so many haters, that I have to rate it a 10/10 instead of 9/10, maybe that way there will be some balance between haters and real viewers.Just watch it because it actually has the potential to be one of the great TV shows. As i watched it, I was quite happy with the characters, graphics and developments (let's be honest how much development can you actually have in 2 episodes...).Important things to take in account for people who watched GOT and expect more: 1. It is not based on every faction, it is based only on one faction ""The house of the dragon"". 2. This series revolves around ""The house of the dragon"" so basically you will not see anything regarding anything that does not involve this ""house"".This is my personal opinion, so don't get annoyed if you disagree, just give it a chance :)"
UPDATE AFTER THE FINAL OF SEASON ONE
IDC I STILL LOVE IT ITS STILL AMAZINGJust finished ep 7 and i loved it
"its probably my favorite so far everything about it was amazing the fights ,the dynamics ,the end loved all of itHonstly i dont get why people Are leaving bad review"
The characters and the casting are amazing and the plot is incredible
sure they are moving quick but i honestly dont mind that much its important they do so for the action to start like do people expect children to fight the entire time???Other than the pacing i dont see anyone complaining about anything else so at this point i just feel like people just want a reason to complain after GOT season 8.
WOW what a way to start . The first episode was great . Cinematography dialogue was top tier . That what made Game of Thrones great and I'm sure it will make THE HOUSE OF DRAGONS great to . Enjoy everybody THE SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is back .
"I've watched the first two episodes with great interest and I think the show absolutely delivered!! I don't understand why people are comparing it to Game of Thrones. House of The Dragon has its own legs and I think it stands firmly on them!! The majority of us already know this story and how it ends. With that being said, I truly appreciate how it's being fleshed out so far!! My only hope is that they don't build us up and let us down!! I want to see the story and the characters rise to their full potential!!I love the tension brewing between King Viserys I and Daemon, as well as the sexual/power tension between Daemon and Rhaenyra.The sets are amazing as are the costumes and so far, for me, the acting is pretty good! I also like the cast!! I'm strapped in and ready to ride this Dance of Dragons!!! Let's go HBO!!!If you give it a try with unbiased eyes, you won't be disappointed!!"
"Unfortunately, while still enjoyable, for the lack of something somehow equivalent, the show lacks the maturity (dragons and zombies excluded) and fierceness of the original GOT. It feels like Disney adaptation smartly engineered to be syndicated to the widest array of buyers and audiences. Everything the original was not. While I still - like many - had issues with the supernatural, unnecessary elements of dragons and zombies (not yet appeared in this one), House of the Dragon, seems like kids in a school play. The plot seems the well-trodden one, with heir issues and all that we have quite digested to death."
"THIS is what I wish the original Game of Thrones had been!! While the characters and storyline in the first series were very strong, I feel like it was far too heavy on the debauchery and excess. I understand that's supposed to represent that period in history, but it was a lot. This series however ditches most of that and focuses almost solely on the story and character development. Childhood angst and independence are present and strong, pride is a huge factor, the importance of an heir is driven home, and the power of the king is nearly untouchable (and seemingly accurate). The weaknesses of the king though are also there. I just feel like this series nails so many points of life and the way things were in that time. And the story is awesome. All the good, but without the junk. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I don't know if I could ever give anything a perfect 10."
"The costumes, sets, and effects make it worth watching. The casting and plot make it not worth paying much attention. It's more like an interesting screen saver than anything else. Young Raenehra was the only truly outstanding performance but they replaced her early on with some stranger that ruined my immersion going forward.It's a shame such a large budget was wasted on pedestrian writing and casting. Not that there weren't some great scenes though. Most of the sets are magnificent. The dragons are well done. An altercation between the children was a glorious achievement in suspense. All in all, the DPs really knocked it out of the park. If only the writing wasn't so bland."
"I worry people are rating this show highly because of their love for GoT. This is a much duller version. Slow, mundane writing along with characters that aren't developed enough for you to connect with them. Barely an ounce of shocks or plot twists. We're nearly a season into the series, 15+ years have passed and STILL you could summarise the major events in a few sentences.If you're going to jump forward substantially in time you better be building up to a big moment. Alas, that hasn't been the case. The main storyline on episode 9 was just people trying to find Aegon, snoozefest. I'd advise people watch to get a feel for the show but unless it drastically improves I won't be watching season 2."
"First of all, I absolutely hated season 7 and 8 of GoT. It completely destroyed the mysthic and magical part of this show (white walkers). As already mentioned I hated how they finished the story line of the white walkers. It was waaaaay too fast and cheap.All the other endings - decisions and developments of characters - were unlogical and dumb too.But house of the dragon. Wooooooow. This show is fantastic. It brings back the memories and the 10/10 quality of the first 5 GREAT seasons.If you watched this show you can absolutely see and feel the amount of passion and love the writers and actors put into this project. Its a 9.5/10.And compared to RoP its a 1000000/10."
"The acting felt authentic, powerful, and the story line is strong. As a book reader and GOT fan, I'm happily surprised with the first episode. The pacing was great, and the subtle references to GOT were well balanced and not overdone.It's also worth mentioning that the costume design for this season has so far exceeded my expectations. I was worried that this might get glossed over. The attention to detail is obvious in the clothing pieces worn by the Targaryens, from Daemon's armor to King Viserys' coat with Balerion the dread embroidered on it.Also, for those upset about the color of Corlys Velaryon's skin, I encourage you to take a good look in the mirror. Upset about a made-up character, in a made-up world about dragons? Please, there are real problems in the world, and this is not one of them."
Where my boats at? Where my dragons at?I was skeptical. I watched the first 3 episodes and so far I am extremely satisfied. This is how you have a show with strong women characters. This is how you balance a storyline. This is how you write dialogue. The characters are well written and acted. The costumes are very good. The CGI is great. There is only one spot where it looks like they stretched the CGI a little thin. You are going to have that though.HBO you did just fine. Don't mess it up!On a side note I never read the books. This show is actually making me interesting in reading the novels.I always been a Tolkien fan. I read all of those books. Since Rings of Power offers nothing for me I think I will be diving into this world of boats and dragons. I am stoked.
Okay the first episodes started off slow but the last last episodes really kicked off something beautiful as good as game of thrones hope the writters keep the pace of the the last 5 episodes then am really sure we will get something as good as got or even butter i wish
And i want them to make the show unpredictable showing us things we didn't expect thats what made got epicI really hope they bring the white walkers cause the white walkers were so epic in got tramendous episodes like hardhome and beyond the wall will always be my fav in game of thronesAnd i really wana appreciate the deamon character i really lov3 him soo much he is so unpredictable
And for obvious reasons i want rhaenyra to sit the iron throne.
"After the disappointing end to GOT, I feel its a great pilot which not only had the feel of GOT but also had good mixture of characters. It feels as if the characters are very unpredictable. GOT was different in that it had characters of moral code and it felt that their decisions were morally correct. But the characters in this show are very unpredictable in that they can be a hero or a monster on any given day. . Hoping it delivers.... Although its just the begining it certainly has the potential to be great..."
"You know what? Yeah, let's do this. Two episodes deep right now and I'm really feeling this new series. The cinematography, tone and acting is really on point here. It really feels like they're building something here; something looming just over the horizon, and I can't wait to see how it unfolds. I hope the screen writers stay focused on this series, because I think a lot of people are looking for something satisfying to stick with. Some are calling this boring, but you should really decide for yourself. If you've ever read the books, there's a TON of this kind of dialogue and story-building in the original series. Plus, there's dragons. I mean, come on! Give it a shot."
"Not a fantastic start but a decent one. A bit boring after all the fuss that were surrounded its production. I have been also expecting a spectacular opening credit like before but was left disappointed. However, I liked Rhaenyra character very much. She resembles Daenerys a great deal. I remember how engaging the premiere of GOT was. Nonetheless, this one looks promising as well. Must wait to see how the story unfolds in the coming weeks.7/10 solely for the first Ep."
"I dont see what all the negative reviews are about. What I wish happened was to see the same actresses who played the young Rhaenyra and the young Alicent from episode 1 through 5 grow up in front of our very eyes and see them continue in episode 6 and on. They both did great jobs. But producers decided to flash forward the story in episode 6 to when they become young women now and we see new actresses playing them. This time with their own families and heirs both secretly vying for the throne. It took a little getting use to but once the old Rhaenyra made love to her uncle in episode 7, that all changed really quickly! Also to note I do feel sorry for Lord Daemon. He's definitely a bad person, but he is only playing by the rules that his forefathers put before him. I just feel empathy for his character more than anything. And thats really the strong suit of this show that reminded me why i loved GoT so much. Each families heir battling control over the Iron throne because it's power & fortune they all seek. And some of them are willing to do just about anything to get it."
"Game of Thrones, the TV series, was made great, at least the first four to five seasons, by Martin's (and Martin-inspired) amazing, witty and creative dialogue delivered by the wonderful cast. The books are also completely resting on the greatness of interpersonal relationships and dialogue while being essentially quite weak fantasy. In fact, I would go so far and argue that Martin wanted to write books about political intrigue and aristocratic families and added fantasy only as an outer shell to make it more colorful. This is important to understand to see why the later B&W seasons failed miserably - illogical character development, ludicrous storylines and weak, charmless dialogue. House of the Dragon, so far, tries to steer clear of ill logic but delivers the same weak, charmless dialogue. This is understandable because dialogue makes or breaks books, films and TV series and is arguably the most difficult aspect of writing to master. The cast is middling with some real duds like Matt Smith who is appropriately charmless, but also annoying and not nearly menacing enough. Paddy Considine's Viserys is bloodless and uninteresting, Toussaint's Corlys likewise. Milly Alcock's Rhaenyra Targaryen is the only interesting character of the lot, although clearly based on Cersei Lannister and the cliched (but often true) tropes of underestimated and ignored women. What is less understandable to me is the often atrocious CGI. Just go and rewatch the knights' tourney in episode 1 and marvel at the 2-dimensional people in the stands, at times completely warped perspective and ridiculously bad level of detail."
"I've watched 4 episodes so far and I haven't found the part that makes this show interesting. I couldn't care less about these characters, I couldn't care less about who will be the heir to the iron throne and I couldn't care less about any plot points for this series. The visuals are good, the dialogue and the acting is good, but sadly nothing else is good. When Game of thrones started, they introduced the characters well and every character had their own element and story. The characters were interesting and the show waited for the viewer to get used to the characters before throwing anything big to the table. House of the dragon assumes that the viewer already likes these characters and every scene is somehow impactful. Well sadly it's not. This is show boring and uninteresting."
"Amazing for if you love dragons, knights and royalty. Matt Smith does a great job of acting in this programme series.Worth a watch and can't fault it. Great for fans of game of thrones, the whitcher, the wheel of time etc. Amazing story line. Historic and great.Matt is a great leader and he goes all to get to his brothers kingdom to stop poverty and squaler with his army of men he calls ""hounds"". Old fashioned clothing and swords etc.Matt and his hounds go all too to make sure any thief's, criminals etc don't do it anymore. With some graphic and bloody content.Matt is quite serious but still has that slight funny smirk to him at times in the episodes. Typical programme with at least 1 actor pregnant already at start etc."
"I like it though. Well done, I expect it to get better. What I do like about this 1st episode is that it hits you harder then GOT's 1st episode. They should have put in a few more twist because they left it a bit predictable for next episode."
A good show but got s1 was better than hotd s1 in every aspect other than vfx I guess. Couldn't connect with the characters because of the all the the time jumps. Other then viserys every other characters felt bland compared to got. Dialogues and interactions weren't as good as got.Those are my main complaints other then that a well written show. And an outstanding cinematography.Didn't have many great characters
It had but not good as got.Goods
>Great acting
>Viserys
>Cinematography
>Direction
>WritingBads
>Pacing
>Time jumpsHotd was good but It wasn't as good as it's predecessor but i hope the ending will be better then it's predecessor....
"Has the king of television returned?With the disasterous ending of G. O. T Season 8, and the rightly deserved fan backlash, it was doubtful H. O. T. D could ever win over hearts and minds of scorned Game of Thrones fans. I was one such person. The bitter taste leftover from seasons 5-8 had really killed off any interest I had in revisiting Westeros in any form... however....Its undeniable this show (at least for Season 1) is pretty damn good. The sets, characters, slow burning political intrigue, tension and action, are back to the quality G. O. T set in its heyday.If I had any complaints, I'd say that there wasn't one particular character I found myself rooting for or became very invested in, but the potential has been laid for that to develop in future. As long has they don't mess up Season 2, this show has every chance of reigniting peoples love of the GOT universe, and who knows? Maybe even become just as big as its predecessor once was."
"Not bad. Not bad at all. A good start. The events are slow, but it is worth the wait. The acting of the characters was perfect to an excellent degree, and this is what we are used to in Game of Thrones. I hope that their interest in the book about the series is excellent. Is it better than the beginning of Game of Thrones? Especially after the last episode of the first season, I hope they do not disappoint, as they did in Game of Thrones. One of the best characters for me is Damon. The development of this character is wonderful. I relate to him from the first episode. He has the spirit of a leader. He reminds me of Jon Snow. He is not afraid of anything, but he is smarter than Jon Snow. He is not led by his feelings. An excellent personality, especially the acting from the actor. It was excellent. I hope for a better second season."
"I swear just watched first half die hard fan I didn't like the start of this serious but I grew to love the cast, previews for nest episode show a time lapse with older characters not played by the same actors!!!I swear you forced me to fall in love with the original cast. If you change this cast... I will continue to support the series. But that was a monumental mistake. We established a bond with this cast!! And it was earned, I'm sorry to see them go If that was the case but much money lost, you could have dragged this series out with original staff now me have to get used to new characters!You don't don't do that unless that's the whole premise. I'm heartbroken. I want to see my characters future develope. I just hope the preview for future episodes were misleading."
It's watchable but not a patch on the mesmerising complexity of G. O. T.Matt Smith seemed badly miscast in terms of his voice which utterly lacks gravitas and there's a dearth of attractive characters to distract from the rather leaden storyline.The sets and CG dragons etc are however outstanding and the fact that the viewer takes them for granted is testament to their high quality and integrity.It passed a few pleasant enough hours but on balance I'd recommend rewatching Game of Thrones itself for some real escapism.As a footnote: Could no one have told them that the correct word was DISCOMFITED and NOT DISCOMFORTED?!
"Looks promising, reminds me of the early seasons of GOT.The characters, the scenery, the music, how graphic it is. It's Game of Thrones but with different people and I love it.Just need to wait and see if they don't mess this up like the last one."
"Some people are so invested in the GoT lore that they will see past the overcooked tropes and score this highly.I find neither the gratuitous sex or violence titillating and beyond that the simple truth is there is nothing new here. Nothing we haven't seen before. It's all very boilerplate.But it isn't taking it's more groundbreaking predecessor to another level. It's reductive. It remains to be seen if these characters will develop and have as much to offer as GoT. But After the first episode I don't see anyone coming close to the Imp, Jaime, Cersei, Varys, Etc. Still too soon.I'll probably watch it because there's nothing else on Sundays but meh."
"I have patiently waited through six episodes and as I feared after seeing episodes one and two GRR Martin has failed abysmally with this serious. The original GOT series , and books, got the right balance between storyline , characters and when and where to introduce some action and neat plot twists. This series however, has Horlicks written all over it.Tonight's episode jumped forward ten years and unlike the original GOT we've got a very different cast for the same characters, very confusing for the first few minutes and as per the previous five episodes, all talk and no or very little action."
"I loved Game of Thrones!Now, I'm completely engrossed with House of the Dragon, what an awesome prequel.Season 1 was more than I expected.I'm on pins-and-needles, waiting with high expectations to see what season 2 has to offer.Season 1 had an incredible cast, I have extremely high expectations for Season 2 cast.According to recent tweets, Charlie Hunnam, will join season 2. If this is true, he would be a great addition. I would like to see Hunnam and Travis Fimmel play brothers, now that would be an awesome pairing.Rumors are circulating that Katheryn Winnick is joining the season 2 cast, I'm hoping that this is just a rumor. I mean what a way to ruin a great cast, I'm so sick of Hagertha and her less than par acting skills. If the goal is to have scenes that closely resembles the ""Exorcist"" with all that tongue action then they hit the mark.House of the Dragon Season 2 .... Bring it on!"
"Sinple terms these days, huh?In the world of woke incompetance, unlikable characters, analogies of 'stones looking down, ships looking up' we love... LOVE, I'll tell ya!!!!Just something logical, immersive, and normal.A story, told by a person who has once talked to another person in their life, remembered what that was like, and thought: hey!! - that might be useful to remember:-))Mediocre is the new good, good is the new brilliant, and brilliant was tortured to death by J. J. A, slaughtered by Kennedy, and devoured by the stupid.I'm in hell... on a break:-)Thanks!Thanks!Thanks!"
"From the very start of this episode, I could see where the first two were leading us. Every second of this episode had me on the edge of my seat. This is what I've been waiting for. The political and personal intrigues, the motives and ambitions of Viserys (especially where Rhaenyra is concerned), and Rhaenyra herself finally proves to be a real badass! And Daemon shows his heroic side, finally!And dragons! We finally get to see real dragon action and I'm not hating the dragon design as much as I did in the first couple of episodes (though they still don't measure up to the original GOT dragons, in my opinion)."
What a first season of what I predict will become a show that will live up to and potentially surpass it's predecessor (let's just forget about season 8 lol
").I feel so emotionally attached to almost every character in this show despite the frequent time jumps and recasts which were flawlessly executed. I never felt like I missed part of the story which is a first for me. Every character decision felt justified and in line with what I would expect from them.The shots were just gorgeous as well. I am a simp for dragons and the vfx surrounding these huge, mythological creatures was perfect. Also, the camera angles captured the tension or joviality in a scene very well, I always understood the mood of the scene allowing the actors to deliver these killing performances that made me feel all the characters emotions.Overall, I found this show hit almost every beat necessary to produce a fantastic bit of tv that I just can't wait for more of."
"It's without a doubt the best show of the decadeMore dragons, more drama, more politics, more betrayals, more blood, more violenceMy absolute new favorite show!!!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥"
"Absolutely nothing to dislike in this show, after two episodes all the characters are set in tone, it's unmistakenly the same universe just some years back, everything else is pretty much the same. Actors are all very much fitting with Daemon stealing the show but for a reason. Can not wait to see what crazy things happen in this season and how it ends. (Always think back on the last episode of season 1 of GoT) Very promising.The plot itself seems more like game of thrones than the original because in GoT it was a lot about the winter, here it's a lot more court and everyone is even more sly than in the original series which did have sly characters but also one dimensional ones like Ned, Robert etc. Here everyone acts like Peter Baelish. Which i love.The first enemy is looking to be someone outside of Westeros and i can't wait to see more of the across the sea which i loved in GoT."
"Game of Thrones is easily one of the best shows of all time. The final season left many fans disappointed, and some people took the hate of the eighth season and said the entire show was bad. I was definitely one of the people that really disliked the final season, but this... this does put a smile on my face.EPISODE ONE: House of the Dragon is awesome, in story, emotions and it feels like Game of Thrones, the high quality, fantasy-epic show we love. The performances are outstanding, the story is great.. and the Dragons look AMAZING! The CGI-work done in this show is SO GOOD! The first episode does a great job in setting up the rest of the show. It showcases the history in a rich manner, and I can't wait for the rest of this show.This time, it feels like Game of Thrones is back, and not like Season Eight, like the REAL Game of Thrones we know and LOVE!EPISODE TWO: The second episode of House of the Dragon is here. It's called the Rogue Prince, and it's awesome! The first episode I felt was a perfect pilot and a great comeback to this Universe because though the eighth episode wasn't all that great, the Universe still is. The second episode gives the characters more development. This video will be Non-Spoiler. And I loved the entire bridge sequence in this episode. It's so great! Overall, just, this show's going to turn out to be great, and I recently found out the second season has been greenlit. This episode- spot-on. A Great continuation of the first episode's story. I can't wait for Season Two, and the rest of this season and beyond!"
"Good sets, the acting is promising, the characters mildly interesting.Once bitten twice shy.....I am reluctant to invest time and thinking in this series given the debacle that was the Game of Thrones wrap up....but I will give it a chance."
"This was sooooo good. I have been hearing about all these spin offs and prequels for GoT and didn't get my hopes up. The first several seasons of GoT were expertly written and acted, no way could lightning strike twice. I was wrong. It felt like we were transported right back into that world.Just a warning, like every other show these days this will be criticized for the heavily hinted at same sex relationship. Ignore it. This isn't woke bs. It's an adult show with adult themes. Watch it for yourself and be amazed....at least this 1st episode."
"Very good TV for today's standards. But if you compare it to Season 1 of Game of Thrones it's very lacking.The first couple of episodes get you pumped for what's to come, but as the show progresses you quickly realise that instead of characters developing, they're all molding into the same character.Everyone in this series. Every single character has the same goal and same personality. All anyone wants to do in this show is to get power and get laid. And to be frank, it's kind of boring. Everyone feels the same. The few characters that actually seemed interesting only got a few minutes of screen time probably because they weren't important to the plot.And I suppose that's the big flaw here that's causing all of my issues with this series so far. This show only focuses on is the plot. We don't get to see much of how characters interact with each other outside of the plot. We don't understand how decisions effect certain characters. We don't understand why characters make decisions that they make. All we know is ""This guy wants the throne, so he's doing this"" and nothing else.There's no depth to that. As a watcher, I don't care who sits on the throne. I don't have a reason to care about any of the characters. So when they're making all of these political maneuvering and deciding succession and all of that feudal aristocratic mumbo jumbo, it doesn't matter one bit to me. And it's boring.But as someone who's read into ASOIAF lore, I know why they're doing this. They're rushing past this bit. First season is probably just going to be the context for what happens next. Season 2 will probably be the real start of this series. It's just disappointing that's all.Oh and episode 1's CGI over kings landing sucked.Besides all of that, this series is still pretty good believe it or not. Nothing overwhelmingly special, but definitely worth a watch. And I expect it'll pick up next season so you'll want to watch this anyway."
"It makes me wonder why didn't the creators take on the far more logical tale of how the Targaryen's come to Westeros and captured it. What machinations were used and what allies were made to make it work.Instead we get this storyline. It isn't always comprehensible and is definitely not very intriguing, but you get more of the story of how the platinum blondes managed to have such a broad base that it included black ones and how desperately they wanted to have women assume their role as equals (only to need to lose it later since they won't have it in the later stories) and more pointless drivil.A great family (perhaps the first rulers of Dorne would have been more logical for a great house which was black, It could have been shown as more courageously a house fought for and managed to remain a kingdom until the end (perhaps even with the family that cut the successful deal being the House of MarteL).But no! We get this very poor tale of a very weak king."
"The best show ever, keeping up with the hype of game of thrones it's just amazing to watch and fell in love with each and every character, Absolutely amazing...My favorite character is Aemond he's just too good, Also the casting of Alicent Hightower is top notch both the characters Emily carey & Olivia Cooke are jus brilliant in that character. Cam't wait for the next season of House of Dragons. The CGI is brilliant and the background scope is brilliant and the sets and costumes all are just so perfect and I think the first season of House of Dragon is better than the first season of Game of Thrones.."
"I was SO disappointed to see that the show jumped in the timeline already and that Milly Alcock was written off the show. I would have liked to see her in at least a full season or two. She and her twisted Uncle the main reasons that I tuned in. Their performances were amazing. There was so much story telling that was yet to be explored. I suppose I'll watch it at least until the end of 1st season and see if the characters pull me back in. Don't get me wrong, there are lots of good performances in the series, it's just that for me the storyline around her strength and guile kept me interested. I'll keep an open mind..."
The amount of one and two star reviews on here.. funny how a lot of them have the same basic grammar mistakes and the same inane phrasing.. and how many go straight to complaining about 'diversity'? Almost as if it were organised. Look out for the same users when RoP starts next month..The first episode set things up nicely. It's not GoTs and that's a good thing. It needs to be it's own story and exist as a separate entity to the original show. Looking forward to seeing where it takes us.
"Perfect start, lots of room for growth on characters and script but it's episode one. They gave us the feel without overt fan service, we are so back!"
"As for 2022 and we have passed a big winter called covid -19, the story should grow creatively. As people has changed also all the audience, so hopefully they will maintain the standards for present make things great. Of course there will new formation for story telling. So expecting like Game Of Thrones wouldn't be wise. Because this is a new story with new style, A very good luck and thank you."
"The series has started well, which is a good thing. Let's see how it unfolds in coming weeks. Too many sub-plots in a single season will ruin the pleasure which hopefully has been avoided. The premise set in the first episode is well enough for the entire season. Although it has been provisionally rated a high 9 by majority of viewers, I feel a rating of 8.8 by season end would be a job well done."
"I stop from episode 7, the previous episode was 4 stars for me. I understand the series is based on the book, I haven't read the book nor Game of Thrones but the series is HBO's worst series ever. I find Rhaenyra very difficult how it is, really terrible. The dragons were nice to see back but from episode 3 i really didn't like it, the dragons were 10 times better than Game of Thrones. When the 2nd season comes. I'm probably going to watch the trailer for fun but see the series again, not anyway!. Especially I hate the Rhaenyra has 'played' with Daemon, not with a family song anyway, I didn't get to see that scene myself. For the real fans if they read this they will probably get angry but that doesn't make me small. Sorry HBO but this one is dirty."
"What a first episode to begin with. Really great start, A+ acting, and great cinematography.It was really nice to get that old GOT feeling back again which I never thought I would.And don't even get me started on that good old theme song..much loveðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™"
"The main thing which differentiates the new series from Game of Thrones is that most characters aren't compelling, and quite bland. The plot so far is also so predictable it's laughable. I do hope for some plot twists, unexpected betrayals, murder, and general mayhem, but doubt they can produce something on the same level. Prepare to be disappointed if you think this is in any way, shape or form on the level as Game of Thrones (The IMDB rating numbers are quite misleading). All I ask is for a show to be good enough to make me immerse completely into that imaginary world for an hour and forget about reality. So far, I haven't achieved that."
"The show promises the battle for the throne amongst the most recent generation of kids and their parents but has done little to actually outline the definitive sides of that issue. Alicent was a great foil to Rhaenyra in the book but in the show they are to focused on putting both of them against the system in place rather than to actually create any interesting conflict between the two. Other than that, there isn't a ensemble cast that provides they're own individual ambitions and backstories into how/why they're interested in taking the throne. And the plot of Rhaenyra's affair has barley been explored which could've been used to accelerate the conflict between the houses but has been oddly been disregarded. The biggest issue of the show is that is tries to highlight and give importance to the characters of the show during the time period rather than the unspoken conflict of the ""Game of Thrones."""
"Where are the characters we want to hang out with every Sunday? The ones we fear for, we cheer for, the ones that makes us laugh, cry? The ones that are repulsing?The excitement of the Game of Thrones twisted plots? The danger of an unbeatable menace"
"(white walkers) ? ...Bring all that back, please!Instead it's been 4 episodes of long expositing scenes and blabla's (almost mid season) The themes are great but not inserted in any type of exciting action. It's hard to root for anybody up until this point.In comparison, Lord of the rings bring characters you can't wait to follow, situations you can't wait so see unfolded.House of dragons is beautifully shot and directed but we haven't seen its soul yet."
"I never watched Game of Thrones but was suggested to watch this by a friend. I watched it and fell in love with it and after I complete all the episodes will go watch GoT. What made it even better was Matt Smith, I have been a fan since he played the Doctor in Dr. Who. Anyone that loves medieval stories will love this. You have suspense, thriller, and romance."
"What significance does this series have after the Game of Thrones disaster? We know where the result will go. No matter how good is this show (which is i doubt it), this story ends badly. Even in the first episode, there are still references to Game of Thrones... talking about The Long Night, as if it mattered... It's really funny.Cast selections are not good either. I laugh every time Corlys Velaryon appears on screen. Who thought this was a good idea? Who are they afraid of to make such stupid choices? It's obvious that it's a forced cast choice. They should have learned from Marvel Phase 4 that no good comes from forced things and virtue signaling.And finally, George R. R. Martin, stop lingering and finish your books."
"The Powerful Casting And Powerful Scenes Its Totally a Great Series i ever watched.Most of it's Vfx ohff another level and one thing I'm In a Virtual world after I've see the whole episodes. However the story going one a big war and the conclusion goes to the game of thrones and My Fav Queen Daenerys Targaryen how she born and how is she in real it's all gone to reveal lets watch how the story goes. And will it's make more goosebumps scene ever we watched. Daemon Targaryen it's a scary character and Rhaenyra Targaryen the black Queen i also loved her she is so beautiful. ""All the best team House of the dragon"""
"Perfect start, perfect cinematogrophy , soundtracks ,acting , every thing is perfect , the theme of the serie that little darkness ðŸ–¤, also the caracters presentation. The dragons with thier details , such a perfect episode and a perfect start for the most waiting show in the world ."
"To be fair I was sceptical as most fans of GoT and after an underperforming season 7&8 of Got I expected just another show that gets milked.But the first 4 episodes had me and I am feeling the Vibes all over the throne. HBO and especially GRR M. Did an excellent job and so far the storyline, the cast, the visuell effects and all the usual intrigues convinced me, that we can and should expect more from HOTD. Will it be better than GOT? Maybe, maybe not, I don't know but so far it's delivering and I think one of the main reasons is that GRR M. As the author is back and involved heavily in to the project and the storyline and you can feel it all over the show. Compared to the first seasons of GOT I think we will follow the pattern, so I am expecting that season one will give us an overall view about the main storyline and the real fun begins with season 2, even if the pace seems slow at the beginning and especially for the first 4 episodes. Also glad to see the great scripting, dialogues and all the efforts that HBO is putting into this show and that I especially miss for other big productions.Have fun and enjoy the show fellas."
I feel people forget how the first 4 episodes of game of thrones bored us to death. I really had to convince myself to see it through. And I was glad I did. It was the same feeling to me watching this first episode. But I must say it was more than I expected. I think it was brilliant. I can't wait to see what the next episode holds. Cinematography is impressive and the actors aren't too bad themselves. I really enjoyed it. I missed the dragons. Glad they are back! Worth a watch. I am a big GOT fan. I also feel like it's unfair to compare it to GOT. It's a totally different era and I loved it.I am very impressed with this. It shows much promise. Love the main characters. Actors are really good.
"It was never going to be as a power house that GOT was. But many of the elements are top notchThe acting is superb. Special effects are ok if not wonky at times.The politics (a key element of the original's success) are brilliant and all living up to standard.But the magic is missing... literally. There's no mystery and wonder, no Dark Arts. No legendary swordsman, No Witches. No Sorcery. It ultimately lacks any mystique. Solely a soap opera. Yes, it has blood and gore and sex but even that feels thrown in like a bone to a mutt.Like everything these days it's full of strong female characters but lacks any real Male role models. Literally every male character is nothing more than a fool.It's rushed, much like the hated final season of GOTAll that said it's still very good! And entertaining.Just not great. And is a tad disappointing."
"Episode 1 lays out the plot and the main characters and still has great politics, dialogue and action. Character development is good and we will start seeing their motivations in the coming episodes. Strong start!"
"As I sit through every week's episode, I find it drags on & on. For example, the week of ""the funeral"" was so boring. The literally stood around looking at one-another for half of the episode. Then, towards the end, the kids had a fight over a dragon. That was the most exciting thing, and there's have been 9 episodes.Granted, the first season of anything is getting to know the characters, but c'mon. This is a GOT installment! It needs to pickup the pace or I'm done waiting. The first season of GOT was super exciting. I recently rewatched it.Not only am I anticipating something to happen, but I can't stand a majority of the characters. I wonder why I wasted an hour every week to watch nothing. And what does happen, I don't understand. So I'll rewind to see if I can understand, yet I do not.I'm sorry, but what happened to who helped write GOT? Did they all quit?Sorry for the negative review. This has so much potential, and I'm hoping it eventually comes around. The idea is awesome, even though I'm confused with the large time-jumps. I really hope this doesn't flop. GOT needs to be amazing all around!"
"I made it to episode 6. This is a fantastically made show with really good locations and acting. The visual effects are beautiful and keep building on the impressive looks of the original Game Of Thrones show.However the show includes a lot of time jumps right after dramatic moments, that don't allow for you to be fully invested in the consequences of what you're seeing.Something bad happens then boom 10 years later and things have changed but no proof that that's because of what happened prior or that more stuff has happened and we just haven't seen it.In conclusion the story would be good if it had been allowed to stretch over several seasons. Here it just doesn't work."
"The first episode was a solid start but the third one had me.Dont get me wrong now I loved Thrones right until the end, but this series seems to have even more potential.Good opening story, interesting new characters with their own motives and ambitions. Happines, tradgedy, all captured in the same story of the introduction. Life. Superb. Strong solid 9/10.Also more dragons and effects then the first seasons of Game of Thrones. More action, love it. You can obviously tell that they have a higher budget and even better standards. Acting, everyone even the smaller parts, brilliant. Love Paddy Considine from the movie the Worlds End (great film!), and Matt Smith plus Milly Alcock are among my favorites also so far! Thrones level of acting, or better? Everyone else also does their part well.Anyway, second episode. Very decent indeed. Interesting continuation of the Targaryen story, new problems coming up. Questions about the heir, who will really get the throne, really exciting, love it! A strong 8/10. Would rate it 8.5 if I could.Then the masterpiece.Third episode ""Second of his name"" is totally mindblowing. It starts right of with ""The Hunt"" and questions about Rhaneyras future and marriage. The King is married again and now has a son. This is a big threat to the powerhungry Princess. We are now three years into the story already and a lot has changed. Daemon is fighting the Crabfeeder and is losing. His brother then offers help and thats when he realises what has to be done if he ever wishes to be a ruler.The last ten minutes of this episode is the true Beethoven and Mozart of film and television. It's like an opera of violence...The best thing I have ever seen so far in my entire life (and Ive seen a lot, rated almost 3000 titles here on IMDB) and this battle scene with Daemon vs Crabfeeder-army takes the price!Never have I ever seen more thrilling action, the music, the tension, the gore. Risking everyting to win, and suceeding. Setting the trap. A true leader goes first in the attack and he does it like a warrior god. Respect. Hats of for Daemon the conquerer, he is my favorite.I cant possibly wait for what this series has to offer next but with this level of entertainment it cant be anything but promising. Totally my new favorite series. I only wonder how they are gonna top the third episode now when the bar is this high but that's up to the creators to deliver.I will be waiting impatiently for the rest of the episodes this season.Valar Morghulis,"
William.
Watched the first episode and was not disappointed.It's good to be back!Note: People need to realise this is a prequel ! Not GoT.All is well and fire will reign !!
If you don't rate it 10/10 i don't know about your taste in series. I loved Game of thrones but this surpassed my expectations. House of the dragons exceeded my expectations and it made me so invested in this arc yet once again. The casts did extraordinary and the director did an amazing job as well. I am simply waiting for more seasons to come with the cliffhangers that we had. I hope that the new season comes soon with lots of more seasons like got originally is. Please shorten the word limit while we are at it. Can i post a normal comment. Utterly hard to post one comment without needing it to be 600.
Outstanding pilot episode with great acting performances and top-notch tension and action. I loved speculating what happens to house Hightower in this spin-off with my buddies because we all know they aren't in the Game of Thrones series. Can't wait to see how this plays out!!My rating: 9/10.
"Promising, but none of the actors have drawn me into after 1st episode like Sean bean did. But it looks like it could be very good. Hopefully after a few episodes I can get drawn into a character."
"So far I have felt like I can really invest myself in this prequel in Westeros to what I consider one of the best TV series that I have ever watched and that is Game of Thrones.The season started slowly but has improved and become a gripping watch leaving me wanting more. The writing and dialogue is every good here and provides the actors with material to really bring their characters to life.The cast has been fantastic even after the time jumps where you as the viewer are required to reacquaint yourself with each change. The CGI has been used sparingly but done well, in particularly the dragons.I am really looking forward to seeing this series grow and breath into George R. R. Martins books which is very exciting."
Everything is 10/10 until I saw some scenes that not belong to the books..
"Rhaeynes targaryen deserves more focus on her role in this show, her roles in the books and her presence and status in the books are critical!Also a lot of characters unfairly disappears from the show even though they have critical roles.And of course the changing in the genetic traits of some characters and houses such as House of Velaryon.The writers are bad and Sara Hess with her agenda will destroy this show if she writes another episode or more episodes and her statements is the proof.. we will see many differences between the books and the show if she continue force the world society problems ""now"" in the show, with this kind of writers I think that we won't get far.We want a clean show without agenda as GoT !!"
"I have watched many series but before watching the first episode of House of the dragon, GOT was my favourite. But no doubt house of the dragons will break all the records."
Seems like they're rushing to tell the story other than letting it unfold like the original game of thrones.Anyone that is bothered by people comparing it to the original should understand why because that's why we're all here.
"I am very surprised at the positive reviews and can only think they are fake or misguided. Not a single part of this programme is enjoyable not he actors ( some of whom are fantastic in other stuff) the writing, the action or the sets. Nothing is right, it should be a good enough show but ir doesn't excel anywhere. Being a latecomer to the original series and having the luxury of binge watching episode after episode due to the amazing story and quality was brilliant. But this slow pile of boring pointlessness that's slowly filling up my tv box and forcing me to watch it out of nothing but memories of the original series is painful."
"This I did not expect. We're back. This had me thrilled throughout. Hard to watch at times but oh my lord was I invested. Matt smiths character is absolutely fantastic thus far. If we continue like this, we may have a real return to form on our hands."
This first episode is a great make up of the last episode of GOT! Now my expectations for this show is really high..
The episode was very well written and the cinematography is just wow!I just can't wait to see how Rhaenyra's character is going to develop. Hopefully she won't end up the way Daenerys Targaryen ended.
(casting changes are not spoilers)
"Why oh why did they replace Milly Alcock w/Emma Darcy to play the older Princess Rhaenyra? (rhetorical question). Replacing characters w/different actors is always risky and in this case unnecessary. Yes, Emma easily looks young enough to play an early teen version of the king's daughter but the actress is 20yrs old. They could have updated her appearance to have her look more her actual age. She was the only main character they replaced because of the '10yrs later' transition.Why is this an issue?Because Milly did a fantastic job playing the princess in waiting. She added a memorable character in the early episodes that stilted by 'Court politics'. She along with Matt Smith's performance it the spark that made you feel that something big was being setup.Her replacement not only looks different but her presence is quite different. I still liked the show enough to watch it but felt this was worth mentioning."
"Now, I will admit, I watched the leaked episode but this feels like this is the start of something big.It feels very familiar to the earlier seasons of Game of Thrones. Strong writing, morally grey characters and a great balance between being a faithful adaptation and welcoming to newcomers.Based on the first episode alone, I think some scenes needed a bit more time to hit and the first episode can feel like loose scenes with not much holding them together. The groundwork is solid though and none of the criticism I mentioned has a negative impact on the experience."
"I usually don't rate tv show high but this time its different. Quality show, every scene is good except some from the beginning which are acceptable. I usually don't rate tv show high but this time its different. Quality show, every scene is good except some from the beginning which are acceptable."
"I loved it from beginning to end, I hope the rest of the episodes maintain the same Quality of Characters and story. The Dragons have risen!!! Let's go.."
"Had potential but after three episodes, no real connection with the characters, just a filler story for what was before GOT. Some stuff is woke so it seems forced to add people of color to balance it out. Other stuff is very predictable and contrived. Will try a few more episodes, reminds me of after MASH. Not stellar, just a time killer. I think the characters could be better developed but I like stories with depth. Magic and stuff is lazy writing and was unimpressed with what they did in GOT and seems to be an easy out, let's hope they do not rely on it as much in this. The dragons as it was said are the power, let's hope they use human elements as the bulk of the story instead, makes for better writing and more believable story line, but we shall see."
"Ok, so, I read one review complaining about people giving a 10. Let me explain, I read the book, and yes I am happy already happy, but is more than that. Right now on tv that are too much of the same, too much of modern politics. House of the Dragon is good, is fresh, and is beautiful. Of course it is not for everybody. If you don't want to pay attention, and let the time take you, there are many Hollywood action on board. This is not Game of Thrones, yet it feels familiar. We cannot compare, the story is different, the time is different, the drama is different. People bothered by violence or nudity don't watch. People giving a 1 are either mad at George because he did not finish the book yet, or they are ""Fast and Furious"" kind of movie fans. The dialogue is so good, different people yet we can relate, different decisions and no hero no villains. It is very challenging. Honestly, knowing the story it does feels like a Shakespeare tragedy. It is intense, and started so well, calm, and elegant. Watch once, watch it twice and decide for yourself what you think. I hope you enjoy! =)"
"Here's an CRITICAL and HONEST review.First of all, it's lame to review 1 episode and judge the whole season.Let's start with the GOOD !Game of Thrones license ! It will feel somewhat familiar... but that's it. No Winterfell, no North.Obviously and naturally the production is of high quality. The same visual quality as the last seasons of GoT. The music has even improved !It does make me curious to see more, and i NEVER watch series and am just very picky and critical in films as well.Yes it did have a good shock moment that i enjoyed..But that's it...1 thing GoT had that we will NOT see in HotD.... HUMOR. Do not expect a dynamic show where the chemistry feels so REAL like GoT.The fun with Tyrion... Tormund, The Hound...."
The sneaky Little finger and Varys...
The mad Joffrey and Ramsey.....
"The honorable men like Ned star, Rob... etc etc..Do you like such dynamics and GREAT chemistry ? It's Devoid in HotD as you could have seen even in the trailer.Guys lets be a little realistic here too... the first seasons of GoT just set the bar TOO high, we might never see such a great combination together. We were lucky to have so many great actors and dynamics then.Allot of times i told myself, if it's just about great production, GoT license, shock moment etc, then Rings of Power will probably beat this show easily.But i was pleasantly surprised nonetheless, the opening felt good... i liked the new ""Daenarys"" more then i thought i would since I somehow can't stand both.And all this criticism in the reviews about Woke'ism.... Like.... If you pay attention to such stuff then you will find what you're looking for.Don't be a fool, look at it objectively first.There is a black guy here... altough he hasn't said much, he fits his role perfect and i enjoy seeing him... so what ?I gave the show maybe a slightly higher rating then i describe it, but it's just 1 episode, it will be unfair to judge a book by it's cover !I have more hope for the show then i did before the release after seeing the trailer, i thought it would be high production licensed garbage like Star Wars.... But it's CERTAINLY not a dumpsterfire like Season 8 !"
I see a lot of good reviews from people gushing about this show and how excited they are about what's to come
"They all seem to have read the book, I have not got round to it yet and I would say this show bores me to tears"
"It's predictable, the acting is pretty bad (script doesn't help) and I have simply no interest in any of the main characters even after 6 hours of building these character profiles up.It's like an 18+ version of Hollyoaks set in the times of yore with a few dragons thrown in"
Loved game of thrones but given up on this after watching the latest episode (6) due to its dullness and the fact the actors changed.I may read the book and come back to it but I doubt it as there is some paint I need to watch dry at home.
"That's how you make a prequel series. Visual Effects, CGI, everything is fine and on point nothing feels off or unreal. Makeup, Costumes, Background Score everything is perfect and on point."
I don't know why people are mad. It's still the pilot episode and people are already judging it as being medicore. People seem resentful.I too didn't like GOT 7-8 seasons but HOTD is not GOT. The starting seasons are always the better ones. We have to look at each season/series individually. Matt Smith as Daemon looks intriguing. Sian Brooke as Queen Aemma Arryn played a small part which was quite unnerving. The iron throne looks Marvelous compared to GOT. I know the series is going to unfold keeping me glued. The grandeur of the show is what I expected. Quite excited for the all the dragons to show as i expect more detail.
"I know how that sounds, and I know how many other opinions are out there about this show, but as a mega fan of game of thrones and a massive nerd in general, Hotd blows Got out of the water. The acting was by far the best feature as Matt smith just takes my attention in every scene, and even just side characters and one offs do a fantastic job of building characters around them. The slow pace in some eyes is horribly boring, but if you are the sort of person that feeds on lore and world building, this show blows you away, as the story shows older lore, it for for shadows the future (Game of thrones) and really nails the detail in character development (unlike Got season 8). I have very, very high hopes in season 2 and believe strongly that the slow and boring gap that some watches can't get past may soon be able to watch season one with a mighty big reward with season 2. What a show!"
"A good start... looking forward for much more exiting episodes, really addicted to Milly Alcock she is looking georgius and outstanding outfit. And Matt Smith he's perfect and suitable actor for the charactor of demon targerian. Really enjoyed. Big treat for us... thanks HBO."
"The First Ep. Was Tremendous, Almost Feels like it's a start of new beginnings with same Old Classic GOT Vibes , With Same Intensity. Hope For The Best."
Super disappointed on the last season of GOT. I was very apprehensive with House of the Dragons. Did it disappoint hell NO!I am loving HOTD it brings back the fond memories of GOT (Season 1 to 7)
I left out Season 8 as I realized I was watching a fake GOT.Characters are fantastic the drama and the coniving ...
Milly Alcock stands out! I love her acting
I actually waited and binge watch episodes 1-5 and I am looking forward to episode 6. I don't want to give out any spoilers just wanted to give my thoughts and comments. This is truly a notable follow up. Congrats HBO for making this a worthy sequel to the GOT universe.
"I really wanted to like this show. But instead of succeeding on its own merit, it is as frustrating as the last season of GoT.Where GoT excelled was having clever twists that, although unexpected, made sense because the background existed to support those changes - the genius was allowing those changes to evolve while keeping the viewer focused on another point of the story until they happened. Season 9 failed because it lacked the nuance but tried to keep the twists, making them unbelievable and forced.HotD suffers from the same lack of nuance right from the beginning. I have not read the books so I can only hope this is a bad screenplay adaptation, but the result is a contrived shadow of what GoT achieved so well.The first episode is just gore for gore's sake. Clearly they frontloaded the carnage that GoT paced so well. The second spends the whole episode building up to an obvious decision, just for the King (who relies on his advisors) to make a completely out-of-character choice to compromise both the entire realm and his relationship with his daughter, never to even attempt to rationalize the move. The third was so thirsty for a battle scene that it forced an outlandish display which yielded an ambush that apparently not one of the enemy saw coming. A dragon materializes overhead at the last second as the prince forgets about the 3 arrows in him and sprints toward a confrontation with the Crabfeeder - which they didn't even bother to show.So far, this is sloppy, desperate writing that will only serve to remind others of the smoldering ruins of what used to be a great series."
Im pretty sure most people had different expectations but it was pretty obvious what this show was going to be. It a Good adaptation of the queen and the princess
"Not my favorite story of GRRM but still great - let's see where they go with it since it's not that much story left and they want to do another season...If you had different expectations and are disappointed, I don't share your opinion but it's legitimate. Claiming it's generic writing and greedy show producer or whatever is just silly"
Its a top shelf series already with a fitting cast.Hope they do another prequel.Actually rather a 8.9/10Enjoy your day.
"Somewhat predictable storylines. Can see what's coming miles away.Definitely lacking in production quality. Doesn't have the natural feel of realism.Cinematography is flat, CGI is good, but not to the GOT standards. It just feels cheaper?Acting is fine, but it feels very rushed in the storytelling. Lacking character depth.The original took many episodes to build the character backgrounds and nurture them. Now it's like ""Let's hit the audience in the face with everything and get it out of the way.""I'll record it and watch at leisure, unlike watching the original live aired."
"So i want to start this off by saying I'm reviewing this as a stand alone show separate of game of thrones. Of course on its own it feels like a expensive drama like if somebody gave days of our lives a million dollars, That's the overall tone of the show. Every scene feels like it has no concequences for the characters good or bad no scene drives the other it's all just poorly written. I honestly can't even tell if the actors are failing because the writing can't tell how they want there characters to act! Leading to my main point there are no protagonist/antagonist meaning no conflict! Who am I rooting for? Rehnirha isn't our protagonist 1st her character is as flat as she is stupid if someone stabbed her in the next episode her death would mean as much as crab face dude. It's not the queen she's unlikable also flat and we haven't been shown anything to justify her decisions. I'm sorry I'm not trying to drag on I wish I could cover it in one review but damn this is bad!"
"I wasn't expecting House of the Dragon to be quite as remarkably good as it is and wildly it has easily become one of the strongest dramas of the year for me. Instead of trying to mimic GoT's expansive scope and broad cast, it doubles down on terse inter-personal conflict. What you lose in variety, you gain in tension and the crisis points of the series are almost mesmerically intense. The only drawbacks for me was some clunky age re-casting and the occasional ""digitally darkened"" sequence which never work. Beyond that what a phenomenally strong ensemble cast of performers, what amazing costumes, what incredible twists and turns. I utterly loved it and I can't wait for more."
"I was disappointed in the final season of Game of Thrones. I didn't know if this would pull me in. Would it be like The Mandalorian which brought back Star Wars fans equally disappointed in the Last Jedi?Indeed the first episode of House of the Dragon won me over. I look forward to next episode. Matt Smith does a fantastic job as Prince Daemon. His swagger on horseback during the joust was General Zhukov (Death of Stalin) like. Emma D'Arcy as Princess Rhaenyra also has got a huge weight on her young shoulders to pull off she's queen material but she pulled it off.It's well written, really more Game of Thrones (with the politics of playing for the throne) than the last few years of GoT. And people don't act like idiots. There's not a bad guy per se, though many people in the House of the Dragon world think it's Prince Daemon. In George RR Martin there's not a side that's completely evil. That's too easy. In human conflicts, George RR Martin believes, there's often good people on both sides. Although Prince Daemon exudes swaggering confidence that seems to imply great ambition -- in this first episode he doesn't actually do anything disloyal. He's called for account of his toast to the stillborn death of the King's heir but Prince Daemon explains we all grieve in our own way. Time will tell but it seems Prince Daemon will be playing this game of thrones. Interesting he seems to have a good relationship with Princess Rhaenyra and they like each other."
"Yeah I mean compared to she-hulk it's a masterpiece it was refreshing I liked it and can't wait for episode 2, quality writing, the atmosphere, the decor, really superb, I also love the acting."
"Great as the original. The story have began very nicely❤ and also it was as i thought, so i'm really grateful.. Do not judge it, from the background. Please enjoy it's story.because Some people do not see the story of this, they expect another things. Finally, great story. Love it so much."
"It is very difficult to do a prequal and stick with the elements of the original. However, I think that 90% of the show, in fact, represents the same aspects of the original GoT show thus far. The characters are easily recognizable, the storyline makes sense (albeit, a few oddities, likely to cater to the ID politics crowd), the music and ambiance is relatable, and the feel of the overall product is in sync. It feels like the watcher is still in the Realm, and the references help to paint the whole picture so it actually makes sense. Unlike the LoTR disaster, after 3 episodes, House of The Dragons has not disappointed."
"Pros: against my expectations it did hit the nostalgia note and the writing seems actually decent. It both feels GOT and it feels different. I loved most of the original show's world, but it was obvious it could not be recreated and not feel cheap and inauthentic. I can see a value in this being its own entity; at least I am willing to give it a shot at creating its own atmosphere.The beginning is reminiscent of the first season of GOT with focus on court intrigue and I don't mind that, though the mystic element is yet lacking. Looking forward to the next ep. To get a better idea of where this is going.Cons: Not a huge fan of casting, especially the Daemon character. Dragons' and landscapes are so CGI heavy that it reminds of JJ's Disney Star Wars (in the most awful way). Though, I am willing to overlook that if the writing can adequately compensate. The original wasn't always great in all respects either (e.g. Cheap Dornish sisters plot...).All in all, it could never measure up to GOT, which is arguably one of the best shows ever. The cast is nowhere near, while the grandeur and vividness were swapped for CGI cr*p. But, it was unreasonable to expect that it would. I didn't, and therefore was able to have fun watching this.P. S. Really funny and pathetic to see an outrage and accusations of ""woke-ism"" over a single Black actor who is not an extra... imo, the actor actually seems more solid than most leads."
"In an attempt to stretch out the seasons and get as much dough as there is for the taking, the show runners give us a very dull and stagnant start, taking five episodes to tell a story that could've been told in just two episodes, making the show a soap opera more concerned with gossip and feelings rather than mature themes like loyalty and sacrifice.The show becomes better enough to make you invested from the sixth episode onward but not enough to release that fast forward button.There is a huge difference between taking your time to build up a story and dragging. Fire & Blood (the book this show is based on) was really good because it was written as a history book detailing only the significant events that changed the course of history in Westeros and the world of Ice and Fire.And while on the subject of comparison, this show feels a lot closer to the second half of it's predecessor game of thrones(namely seasons 5-8) than the earlier(excellent) seasons. The dialogue is cheap and the pacing is agonizingly slow.I wish for a better second season but I strongly suspect it will be just as dull."
"Actually, I was not so hopeful after disaster final season of GoT. At the beginning of the season first of HotD, time was flying so fast and time to time I've felt big spaces among scenes. However, with episode seven and eight, the genius of George Martin showed up. We can easyly call this masterpiece a novel, not an ordinary tv shows. Thanks to HBO and all scenarists. Here is my critics for shows: We can not find similar aristocratic atmosphere with GoT in this show. Houses feautures not so marked. Even we can not see the heraldries of some houses. Also, At least small stories from Casterly Rock, Winterfell or Old Town could have been showed us for creating bigger reailty of Viserys age and Westeros atmosphere. Keep going Martin!"
"I am enjoying it so far but it seems really slow and not much has happened. There's so many great larger than life characters in the original series, telling multiple interesting stories and you get to know them all pretty quick. I can barely remember more than four characters in this so far. Daemon Targaryen is the only interesting one so far, everyone else is a bit dry and just a bit boring and not very interesting. Maybe it's just a slow start as I'm only 4 episodes in but I'm already starting to get bored. I've been binging the original GOT the past few days and people who say it's just as good, I think we must be watching two different things! There is great potential though for this to be an awesome show and I really do hope it gets a lot more interesting! It has not gripped me yet though as the original series did within the first couple of episodes. As of yet, I don't think it's comparable to GOT, not enough interesting characters and storylines. I hope I'm wrong!"
"Pulping a dude's head. Slaughtering citizens with explicit dismemberment. Hacking open a woman. A casual orgy. A little extra nudity. Yay?Why am I supposed to care about any of these people? The show had to hook me with a character because I know how this story ends already. I know what happens to the last of this family's line! But I don't care about any of them.The creators of this show seem to think GoTs was a hit because of sex and gore. But it was a hit because we were invested in the characters. How could they be dumb enough to not get this? We will watch shows about bad people but we have to care about those people (Tony Soprano, for example). Episode one of this show gave me nothing to care about.This show was already a bad idea because the outcome is a given and we've been told this family is a hotbed of incest and madness. But they could have grabbed us a little with a character that mattered. But they blew it. Badly.Dragons aren't enough."
"I really thought the start was subpar, somewhat underwhelming but with the sixth episode the game changed. One might say the show starts with the sixth episode. After a long time I felt as I did while I was watching the fist seasons of GOT. The casting change made wonders. However, criston cole and daemon targaryen not aging as the rest of the cast either completely changed or artificially aged is not easy on the eyes. They should be more attentive to detail. On another note I really liked how they portrait Aegon, he is going to be a real charmer. I also must say, even though there is nothing wrong about velaryons being black but it would be better if they lost the dreadlocks. They look like bad cosplays of jack sparrow."
"Well written, stays true to the story arch dosent play modern real day politics, they make sure to nod to the book reader thats lookinf for cannon and the giving the ten foil hat sect of our fan base juicy hints to make thier imagination, the cast dosen't attack people on the internet, and the studio that produced it isnt gaslighting through paid schills ,just focused on what ther their to do entertain and bring fans old and new together. Not to mention the beautiful new way of showing us westeros ,keeping what worked and discarding what didn't this has the rare potential of surpassing the original show."
"Very good pace of the show, more simple then first episode of GOT. That can be a good thing for entire series you don't need every story to drag itself more then it's needed, amazing choice of actors, you can feel the chemistry. Show is very brutal and gory, I love it! Can't wait for the next episode!!!! 10/10."
"I don't like writing reviews after just one episode but I think this is an exception because it is not that new of a show to us. I believe they did quite a good job regarding the production, storyline, cinematography, directing, and of course, the music. Although, I do have a little problem with the fact that it seems like there aren't that many main characters in the story, unlike what we saw in GOT. This is not necessarily a disadvantage but I sure hope that in the coming episodes more main characters are introduces to create and demonstrate a much bigger world than it was shown in the first episode.Overall, I have high hopes for the show and believe it has the potential of becoming one of the greatest ones. I will definitely revisit my review in a few weeks."
I didn't realise how much I missed seeing a dragon until there was one flying on my screen. I still find it amazing even though I know it's CGI & mythical! This was a great first episode with all the hallmarks of GOT. I can't wait to see where it goes from here.
"Not sure what these people who rated this as a 1/10 are on about here? Only a hater can rate a show a 1 after first episode. First episode was great, it gets a 9/10 from me only because it felt a bit weird seeing dragons immediately, I hoped for an longer intro. It moves too quickly for my liking. We'll see how it goes from here on... so far strong 9."
"Just saw the first episode of House of the Dragon with my younger brother. The first scene with the dragon flying was spectacular and it was such a warm welcome back to Westeros. The cinematography, clothes and settings were good and the presence of Matt Smith as Daemon really delivered on the best this show had to offer. There are some areas that were concerning however. First of all, the wigs of the Targaryaens look bad. They look unnatural. In particular the lead role - Rhaenyra. Milly Alcock looks bad in that wig. The actress has a somewhat flat affect and in that wig she looks - unattractive and odd. The casting in general was a concern as well. The original Game of Thrones was not guaranteed a success. But HBO got people like Lena Headey, Sean Bean ( experienced leading actors that the audience will instantly recognize and root for) involved. Now this show has all the return on investment that money men like - and they hire inexperienced actors. HBO knows that this show is standing on the shoulders of the giant GOT but they don't hire an amazing established puts people in the theatre seats lead actor or actors? Matt Smith is it?"
"Six episodes in and still there is no intrigue, no air of mystery, and no hints of exciting future. All because the series is refusing to leave the palace grounds and explore the fascinating world that we all had fallen in love with. The crab lord (or whatever his name was) was the only small glimpse of the intriguing westeros we have got so far. There are infinitely more mysterious things that GoT couldn't cover or the writers can freshly imagine. But for some reason they want to revolve around the kingly/queenly affairs, which by themselves will be boring and end up as a run-of-the-mill political story. I sincerely hope all these episodes are just a setup and we get to go on an outdoor adventure in the future. But if it's too far in the future, there won't be any interest left among the viewers and HBO won't renew it.PS: I love how some episodes jump several years. Such jumps allow the characters and stories to mature quickly. Hope the writers use it as a tool for some clever storytelling and surprises."

"1) Stakes are extremely low. So low that I'm casually watching each episode pass with no real excitement on what to expect next episode.2) How many times must i see a woman in this show giving birth to a child. Lmao. I think i saw it around 5 times by now in extremely detail.3) Not anything to get excited about except the succession of the Iron Throne and the war in the realm. No side adventures like the wall, the white walkers, Arya traveling to Essos, Brand magical abilities, Boltons Starks and Greyjoys politics.4) Larys is a poor imitation of Littlefinger so far that we don't know what his role is in the show. He is mostly a combination of Ramsay Bloton's madness and Litlefinger schemes. I don't like or understand him5) Two scenes that really left a bad taste of my moth was the Rhanys cringe dragon escape and killing hundreds of innocent people and secondly the rambo scene of Daemon dodging hundreds of arrows and making it out alive after running such big distance in episode 3."
"If you compare the first episode of GOT to this show first episode, then it's clear to see this is nothing but a case off for making more money. I was in awe when l watched the first episode of GOT, but this one just put me to sleep. They think more must be better, so they have lots more dragons, probably gonna be more violence and sex too. But all that will not make it a better show. Many of the actors are badly cast, and most of them don't look right or sound right, no amount of wigs can change that. Matt Smith sounds more like a muppet than a fearsome warrior ! Like many GOT fans, we all hope this will be good at least if not great, but after watching the first episode, the omen is not good."
"Nostalgia deluxe! First episode was more than I thought it could be! I'm obsessed already. The actors, the dragons.. everything was fire! I wish it was a new week and a new episode already! This is what we all need after a long time of covid and world disaster! Thank you to everyone on this show."
"The first episode sets the right tone for what to expect from this series. The overall feel (ex, cinematography, characters) is very similar to the peak GOT episodes - just with more dragons and seemingly fewer central characters. Hope this series is able to continue this rhythm."
"The set design, the costume design, the music, the camerawork, the dragons; all of it is absolutely gorgeous. I feel like they are really doing G. R. R. M's universe the justice it deserves. In the first episode my family and I experienced such an incredible range of emotions through brilliant writing and brilliant characters. Though so much story was told, it did not feel rushed. After watching the pilot I am very hopeful for the rest of the show.Game of Thrones' ending was simply a disaster, I am with the vast majority of people who were incredibly dissatisfied. This will NOT happen with House of the Dragon. The ending to HOTD is already predetermined and fully written by G. R. R. M who wrote the plot of the earlier seasons of GOT that we know and loved. As a ASOIAF book enjoyer, I know the plot and ending of HOTD, and I promise that this will be an incredible ride. This show not only contains that writing, but as I stated in the beginning, absolutely incredible production."
"Game of thrones is back!First things first, it's very geeky. It's got kings and knights, crowns and swords, dragons and ghosts. Medieval drama is a genre we get precious little of on television (or in movies, for that matter), and Game of Thrones has nearly 10 hours of it. Plus, the series of books boasts fans who are as serious about the happenings in Westeros - where most of the book's action takes place - as any hardcore Trekkie or Star Wars geek is about those sagas.2. The story is compelling. Befitting an incredibly popular series, the books are packed with chapter after chapter that abruptly end in cliffhangers. The dialogue is often funny, acerbic and sometimes even heart-breaking. Though the books are as thick as phone directories, the story moves quickly, and it's almost guaranteed to surprise you. In all my years of reading, seldom has a plot twisted so suddenly that I am shocked enough to say something like ""Holy --"" out loud. A Song of Ice and Fire has done that to me many times, and HBO's adaptation looks to follow.3. The characters come first. Even if you're not someone who likes fantasy, you will enjoy Game of Thrones, because it's not so much a fantasy tale as it is an outstanding character-driven drama that just happens to be set in a fantasy setting. Westeros, the land where the series takes place, is a dog-eat-dog place where most people are playing the angles and looking out for themselves. The end result is a very tangled web of deceit, power plays and intrigue, which should make for an infinitely watchable show.4. Game Of Thrones is based on really great writing. Martin weaves an incredibly complex story that encompasses thousands of miles, dozens of characters and a history that spans thousands of years. Yet, it's easy to follow and just as compelling to read. To tempt you further, Martin was called ""the American Tolkien"" by Time Magazine. This is mentioned not to start a flame war or suggest he is the be-all, end-all of fantasy, but to illustrate how good his writing is. Further, Martin is credited, along with executive producers David Benioff and Dan Weiss, as a writer of the series.5. HBO does a better job at this kind of thing than anyone else. Look at the track record: If there's one thing HBO does better than anyone else, it's original dramas. Band of Brothers, The Sopranos, The Wire, Oz, Deadwood, John Adams, Six Feet Under, True Blood - this list only scratches the surface of the great dramas HBO has brought to the small screen. What's more, with some of the mature content in Game Of Thrones, it's tough to imagine the show being on network television or anywhere else.6. All signs point to faithful adaptation. Martin has been deeply involved with the production since the beginning and - if you read Martin's blog - his excitement is contagious. Plus, the set photography, the images of the cast, the behind-the-scenes vignettes and, most recently, the wallpaper images that depict some of the major locations of the story all show that the series creators really understand what the book is about. That will, hopefully, lead to very good things. Heck, the producers even hired someone to invent an authentic language for the Dothraki. It seems no shortcuts are being taken.7. The series was given a proper budget. With estimates at nearly $60 million for 10 episodes, expect big things on the small screen. And while GoT's budget is somewhat average for a big production series, the fact that HBO committed these resources toward an unproven show says a lot about the network's confidence of success. Early shots of sets, special effects and the cast show the money is being well spent.40 people found this helpful."
Everything is shot so beautifully the opening scenes of each episode still have that immersive feel of the Game of Thrones series . I am so glad they kept that style of filming .All the characters where great I never read the books I only read book one in all and have to say I don't really need to.The young targ children where played by some very good actors loved the squabbling and sibling rivalry going on .Matt Smiths Damon character truly psychotic but with a almost good side. But maybe not as scary as the older disturbed Aemond played by Ewan MitchellPaddy Considine Viserys is a work of Art that guy deserves an award.Each character deserves a award in this series for bringing thrones back to life .
"Honestly I was expecting absolutely nothing when I got into this series, the later ones and of course especially Season 8 of GoT just left their scars on me.What can I say, after one season we're back exactly where we were with GoT, namely terrible writing. So much doesn't make sense, contradicts characters' personalities, the concept of time doesn't exist again, ships and dragons are jets again, people don't age (sometimes the wrong ones), the focus on characters who are insignificant and nobody cares, etc. The weird modern feminist undertones everywhere, doesn't add to the upside either. You don't have to follow every episode live, one birth after the other, which then finally ended in body horror. It's funny that you show something so disgusting, but you can't even see a breast anymore. Nudity probably doesn't exist anymore, so we got a weird foot fetish scene and a teen jerking off on a window frame. (Oh yeah, and it's getting dark again, please someone teach them how to film night shots)It actually started off okay, apart from the white Rastafarian who just stays weird until the end. The fact that HotD was running at almost the same time as the extremely awful Rings of Power probably contributed to the fact that this one seemed a lot better than it actually is. Unfortunately, after 2-3 episodes you realize that there really isn't a real plot and everything just creeps along. I will not go into any content of the series, except that the time jump has massively damaged the series. Practically nothing happens until episodes 7-8 and even these may each have a real plot for 30 minutes. They should have summarized the few key dates from E1-7, and E8, bad as it was written, should have been Episode 1. Virtually nothing prior to this is really necessary to understand what is happening.The biggest problem with the series, it doesn't have a single likable character at all, apart from Ser Harrold. (which is trapped in a time capsule and doesn't age) The show tries so hard to push Rhaenyra and the Queen, but it just doesn't work. Neither of them is a good person, not even in the slightest to have any sympathy for them. That goes for absolutely every single character on the show, all of whom are horrible people doing horrible things all the time. Absolutely every single person could die and I wouldn't care at all and it probably wouldn't even affect the show as nobody would notice they were missing as they're not memorable.(The chances of wishing them dead are higher than caring for them) The writers also have absolutely no idea about drama, which you can tell from the fact that they have to kill an insignificant person in each episode, but they presumably consider them to be ""important"". Ohh, the guy we saw for the first time last episode is dead! Who cares?My interest in further seasons is low, currently HotD is just guilty pleasure material and nothing more."
"I nodded off at least 3 times, anyone else? I can't remember the last time that a show gave away the entire plot of a series in the first episode. Where was all the spectacularness I was promised? This really felt like a SyFy network knockoff. RIP Sandor."
I can see a lot of people complain about rushing or time jumping that's only because they don't understand the story which is a civil war between generations sons will fight each other grandchildren will fight each other everyone has to get old to start the war not only that but you need to understand the two sides who fighting Blacks vs Greens it can't be done by two or three episodes and if there no jumping time we will need like 7 seasons only to start the civil war.This Series is a work of art. Dance of the dragon has a lot of material I don't think we see anything yet. Matt Smith and Emma D'Arcy are the best characters I have ever seen by far. And this is just getting started.
"I'm underwhelmed with the visuals & the toned-down violence.The story sorta pulls you in, but not the imagery. I'm really disappointed in the lack of quality imagery. Most of the outdoor scenes resemble a nuclear winter, especially by the ocean...as if 172 years pre-GOT there were no clear sky's, only fog. Is the budget not accommodating great scenery or real landscapes?? I find it annoying.In GOT, S1, Ep1, from the moment it opens, it grabs you...the dialog is non-existent, but the visuals are clear and inviting. The scenery is crisp. It feels real...as if I could be there, witnessing.Plus, HOD has toned down the violence. Every violent scene this season shows the tail end of the event, or it's viewed from a distance. Is this to appease the ""woke idiots""??Give us what we want!"
"Started to get into this series and then episode 6 happened 10 years later and they replaced Princess Rhaenyra with a different actress but kept other character actors the same. I really liked Milly Alcock as the Princess. The new actress that plays her is good but... Milly was awesome. With modern make-up they could have made her look older as they have done with the King. Milly really did embody that character. Bad decision to replace her.I am confused and don't understand why this story now and why the gaps? I had to stop watching halfway thru episode 6, I am so confused now. Forgive me for not being a super fan that is deeply involved in the lore. Didn't have to be for the original GOT. Not sure if I will pick it back up."
Waited so long for this amazing show and wow for a first episode. What a good start its just build up..much more to come. So i have very high expectations for house of the dragon.Fire will Reign!!
"Writing and cast are very good. It is off to a bit of a slow start, but much of the first few episodes are laying foundations for what is yet to come. It is never easy wedging years worth of character development into a handful of episodes but HOTD is doing a good job with it. At first I was a little underwhelmed but as I get to know the characters better and their storylines emerge, the show begins to hook us in. The original GOT had a similar slow start.In any case the show has Dynamic characters, building storylines, great costumes, nice sets.(though background artwork is a bit much). CGI excellent and lots of creativity evident. It is nice to have a show that is original story lines and not a copy of something from 10 years ago. I am definitely looking forward to more!"
Nothing can match the series of GOT !So is HoD..
In all aspects screenplay action vfx storyline!Best of all..
Greatest of all time..
Must watch...
If you haven't been through game of thrones then it will be like what how and confusing.So I recommend you to watch whole game of thrones all episodes so to get the track of this series.
"Well, tomorrow, people will watch the first episode and Im sure people will love the it. The first episode has all what people wanted in GoT: violence, politics, sex and dragons. As I said, the first episode looks like its make to get old fans, but also the new ones. The casting its so good, specially Matt Smith who plays Daemon Targaryen, I like the idea of hire famous actors and new ones, I specially get surprised by May Alcock who plays young Rhaenyra. The photography its stunning, please, watch how the fire its showed in the episodes."
"What we have seen so far is far better than RoP.First of all, the sets look more realistic and are more lovingly designed. They do not seem empty and monotonous as in RoP. There you see a place only from a distance and then is immediately cut into the buildings and you see neither the path of the characters nor many different places.The dialogues are worlds better and the characters are just more interesting and real. HotD is also far ahead in terms of appearance. Starting with the wigs and armor, costumes etc.What bothers me most about RoP is the fake and clean-looking CGI, which makes everything look polished and therefore fake. HotD has also there a better look that convinces overall, also by proper lighting.The music is then used when it is necessary and not placed over it all the time.There are not as many illogical dialogues and events as in RoP (traversed an ocean, elves that can't fight a troll, walk to the dwarves by foot, jump into a hole with orcs and not knowing who is inside, etc.)Here the decisions have consequences and lead to changes in the world and we see them. Characters Die on screen and not off screen.There is also room for time jumps and not just short uninspired retrospectives.I mean, even the humor is much better and better placed. The actors have a great range of emotions and don't just stare into the void. Honestly, look at Galadriel's face.I hope this review is not also deleted by Amazon/IMDB, like my review about RoP, because they did not like my opinion about there 'cinematic masterpiece'.I was sad about the GoT ending and hope that HotD does not make the same mistakes."
"Personally I feel there is huge low in terms of casting in this new Series compared to GOT, each and every actor chosen in GOT were looking very promising and they has something attractive about them. People used to get attached to their character and personality on the fly. This prequel is only dependent on the story line because I dont see the actors that much attractive as GOT."
"I was shocked, it's the most wonderful thing I've seen today or in my life I don't care hhh"
"that we are waiting for something wonderful we've never seen before, Ramin Djawadi is in another world alone, critics are not critics if they don't generate negative points in their imagination to be difrente."
"The show is rather boring despite the dramatic events and violence.Well, tournament fights, especially first view fight jousting were rather good.While the pilot it's not as great as the first episodes of GoT, it is totally on par with it's final episodes, that's may be worth to watch if you are forgiving and accommodating fan of GoT."
"I read all book George R. R. Martin.People take oaths - the gods laugh at them.The only negative is the very short time of computer special effects.The characters are very well defined.Everyone has a motive, a soul, aspirations, a prehistory and a future. Sometimes short.The theme music and accompaniment are beautiful and unobtrusive.The color scheme is selected by professionals.This series will be renewed for at least 3 seasons based on the pace of the story and attention to detail.I would like to wish the operator not to change plans and angles so quickly. This destroys the magic and breaks the overall picture of perception. I think it will be fixed in the second season."
"It is good but not great.Although its shortcomings are not coming from the production (except some bad casting choices - Daemon being most egregious) but from the source itself.Targaryen civil war is not half as interesting as Game of Thrones. And its described on couple of hundreds of pages. I am not sure how they will expand this to 5+ seasons without having similar problems like with last few seasons of Game of Thrones.And all the fans know how it ended. Dance of the Dragons is well described in companion books.On the good side, its good production and there are dragons :)"
"So, if you are a Game of Thrones fans its certainly watchable but its not as exciting as Game Of Thrones."
First things first anybody who gives this series above a 5 must have something in his eyes and anybody who gave higher then a 2 must have seen a different show.The storyline:
i have seen a lot of series and movies but never have i ever seen a storyline so boring. I started the series promising after watching Game of Thrones 2 times. The first two episodes it started slow but i gave it some time to get started. I wish i didn't. There is literally no action in all the episodes except a small fight against some crabs and between rhaenyra and a wild boar. There a no built up scenes of an enemy who could be a potential threat to the throne and no enemy in general. Every episode is based on rhaenyra become the next person on the throne but nothing about possible enemy's to her. In my opinion one of the worst storylines ever.Characters:
"to be honest this was something i was the most excited about after the original GOT. I expected characters like: the hound, arya, jon snow but al we got was one brother to the king that sometimes swings with his sword and ser criston Cole.Litterely every other charachter could be replaces by anyone and we wouldn't notice because they make no impact whatsoever.Filming:"
The only argument i have for giving this serie a 2 instead of a 1 is because of the graphics. Even tho it is nothing compared to the original GOT it still is al lot better then most movies/series i ever watched.In my opinion house of the dragon was NOT worth the wait and i wish i never started that first episode.
"I did not want to like it. I swore I would'nt watch it. But I got convinced to try it. I almost turned it down at the first episode: too much blood, violence , brutality , soft p*rn ..."
"BUT : I'm hooked, sorry. The characters are extremely complex and well written, the direction is impecable. At first I hated the cast, now they all grew on me because the actors are brilliant, I find it very smart and deep.I really did'nt expect this. I understand that this one is less easy to like than game of thrones , the characters are way more complex and hard to like, if not unlikable at all, but in the end that's what makes it exiting and thrilling.So kudos HBO , you even managed to turn your usual annoying voyeuristic brand into well choregraphed , aesthetic , beautiful and purposeful story telling, which is a notable improvement."
"I gave up on Game of Thrones but this is first class. The actors are so good, the tension, the action, the cgi all create world beating tele-visuals and a convincing Westeros. Not for the faint hearted though as it is still a harsh, violent and unstable world.The lead roles are really good characterisations right from the start with a depth and complexity we don't usually see in television. The sets and the cinematography are also very good. I can see why this has a very high IMDB rating and why many will rate this higher but I do find the world to be a challenging one for me - I'm quite squeamish - and it's not something you'd sit down and watch with the family. Probably because it is so well done, the brutality is all too convincing."
"I am a huge fan of George RR Martins work and the world he has created over the years, and like many others the last season left a bad taste in my mouth, but despite that incident I had faith in HBO and everyone involved in making a prequel. Now the creator of the universe is just as involved as he was for the first seasons of GOT and it's lovely to see that he is just as excited to showcase a new chapter in the world of Westeros.You can feel the love that has been poured into the making of the HOTD, trying to follow the legacy of GOT, but still giving the characters and portrail its own tone and flavour. The cinematography, audiodesign and music is just what we have come to expect from HBO's premium shows. The show is more vibrant, colorful and nuanced, with colors ranging from blue and green to grey and black, but still it doesn't hold back from the gore and uncensored violence. The dialogue is just as captivating with some key stand out lines.This is my most anticipated series this year and I must say we are back at peak television. I will definitely be following along every week and you should too!"
"A great series, directed by photography, the amount of majestic scenery, the quality of production, everything is complete and integrated. I listened very much to it. It deserves more than 10 stars. It is the series of the century, as well as the selection of heroes, enthusiastic music and the voices of dragons.A great series, directed by photography, the amount of majestic scenery, the quality of production, everything is complete and integrated.

After success of the GOT series the team HBO won't rest a bit to effort this type of series. First of all I'll definitely mention the production values are damn good. Whatever the scene it is flawless. Meanwhile it got a good characters and excellent artists to perform their attributes. Do yourself a favour watch this.Considering game of thrones it was a binge watch to see. If you consider the time you watch this it'll worth than much. Witness the unbeatable era of the Targaryen family . As I expected it gave 200/100 . As a got fan I am satisfied totally. If you wanna it is the GOT PREQUEL ITSELF.
"So i found a site where i could watch this and lets just say the 5 epidlsodes i saw where phenomenal. It had a lived in feel, was vibrant and beautiful.It could have come close to a 10 but some of the dialogue choices where terrible.Most specifically the men would rather burn the world than see a woman rule. For one historically wo.an start 27% more wars than men and even with in world we know in the future khalessi starts a war every where she goes zero diplomacy.I like the main girl she is cute in a way and does a good job. I really like how they have her as a cup bearer at the small council meetings its a nice way of showing her education in the realms affairs. She can listen in and see the reasoning behind certain decisions and grow as a result.Matt smiths character also is decent he has a certain cocky edge to him thats intriguing.Over all aside from the few bits of dialougue that arent so thibly vieled slights at men and modern sensibilities its a 8*Definitly reccomend as the W*o*k*e is too a minimum.Just finished episode 6 and it was the time ship. Alicent is a good reasonable character and daemon is smawesome as ever.One small thing i rrally dont like the actrsss that replaced milly alcock as rhaenyra. She is just meh.I didnt like the reasoning on damons wifes ending. It didnt make sense.Over all they landed but are wobbling hard and could still crash.Hope it straightens out."
"...and I think most of that has to do with the casting. I like the story, the production is great but the actors playing the characters don't convince me. It comes across as if this is a GOT light version.I hope this changes in the coming episodes but I am not yet invested in any of the characters."
"Really don't know why there's so many 1 and 2 star reviews here.. This show has the same vibe as the GoT first couple of seasons, sometimes with even better production quality! Great characters, great actors (especially Daemon, played by Matt Smith, which I loved in ""The Crown"" as well). Really curious where this is going! The dragons look a little bit fake, but that was the same in GoT and I haven't seen another fantasy show yet where this kind of stuff is done better (like Lord of the rings, wheel of time, etc). All in all I'm very excited! I was a massive GoT fan and Im very excited that we now got a spin-off the show. Westeros is back! :)"
"The story started very strongly and made the film get very good scores. That's why the fascinating story of the series makes the viewer very keen to continue the story of the series. If the series continues, it can become one of the best series in history, otherwise it won't have much luck. I am very hopeful for the film. It has great special effects and the actors have played their part fairly well. The series has a bright future ahead of it But you still don't have to judge the series very quickly. So far, the actors have done fairly well, but it can be seen that with the continuation of the series, the roles of the film may be weakened and perform poorly, so far fortunately we have not witnessed this and I hope we do not see this."
"Nothing is happening....just plain dialogues....nothing seriously nothing. I would bet anybody can write such a sop opera boring melodrama series. I am writing so long because it wont get published but seriously its so boring. Its better to watch game of thrones series over and over again repeating 100 time over than watch this worthless series. Its so boring that I had to drink coffee to watch this, i am out of words to be honest but its boring. Nothing is happening....just plain dialogues....nothing seriously nothing.

"Episode 1 was epic and brutal, I can tell this is going to be a something big like GOT. It was worth the wait. Daemon,Aemma,Rhaenyra were excellent ðŸ”¥, Syrax and Caraxes looks more colorful and real.."
Really have been enjoying screaming all the characters names and reciting which house they belong to for my girlfriend. Can't wait to see the rest of the show.
"A fresh start from the past is just what we needed after the last season of GoT, right from the first scene you get hooked to the lore and nostalgia. The characters are engrossing and they bring their own uniqueness to the table. You can already feel the impending doom that lays before certain characters and the path they will take. The fight scenes were brutal and the episode had its high moments of tragedy, despair and sarcasm."
This was a great start .looking forward to a wonderful new series. Hopefully we learn more about the dragons from birth to death. Imlocenlae if about Renee's dam.
My favorite part of this production is the execution of high quality CGI and VFX.*What we like:
"-Great CGI (dragons, environments, 3d creatures etc.).-Great execution of renders, virtual avatas and compositing.*What we dislike:"
-Color correction for VFX:
The editors clearly have a bad taste for making the screen too dark on the night scenes.*What we would like to see:
-Virtual production and LED technology:
"From a VFX point of view, GOT should start to implement LED and Virtual Production on the production set.**This is a great example of how VFX should be integrated on a TV Series.**"
"Going into the first episode of house of the dragon I promised myself to have an open mind and I'm glad that I did. The series whilst it might be similar in tone to GOT manages to create its own show centred around very strong characters. From the get go the show establishes a struggle for power, and boy is it exciting to witness. I cannot wait to see what the rest of the season has to offer!"
"Despite how much I like Game of Thrones and the stories of their different houses, I wasn't expecting that focusing on one of them would be developed as a soap opera in which the main threats so far are family treachery, legitimacy doubt of paternity and so on. Honestly, I have never seen so many birth scenes in few time.The story it's explained in a fast pace regarding the years of the characters, jumping quickly, but slow in many other ways if you expect something to happen different from a extreme version of violence and sex of the show ""Dinasty"". There are barely no external enemies, just convenience marriages and manipulations of the truth to get better positioning in the succession line.All in all, from time to time you are rewarded with some surprising character moments, good acting and scenarios, and dragons! That's why I continued watching it, despite some doubts from time to time. I arrived to episode 7 so far, so I think I can do the effort to continue until the end and hoping for more action and some more charismatic characters."
"SO I thought that the pilot was a good sign for the Prequel series, to happen beforehand. Game of Thrones is over no more!The pilot leaves viewers, me at least, interested to know if anything will have improved since the last go around. More red weddings, bloody keeps, and fratricide? I don't really remember seeing a torture as grotesque as Meep's in recent memory. Glad to see GoT is still swinging.Though it's not to say that the new cast and plot isn't up to par. The first episode of the first season has some nudity and a brief sex scene. I guess that is fair because it was in keeping with traditional GoT standards, where the woman is frequently beautiful. The show must go on and all. I can tell this series is on towards a great season."
"GOT had it all in spades , house of dragon while has very good credentials seems to be missing the laugh out loud moments that came with GOT which made the doom and gloom more manageable. It seems to be deliberately dour and what about poor old paddy considine, he has been dying for an age, there is not much left of him.Overall the show is well put together and flows nicely but can be confusing in parts and I feel you may need to leave a trail of cookie crumbs to piece the plot together from the early to later episodes. The dragons are pretty impressive but I would prefer less palace intrigue and more individual story arcs developed."
"I have watched 6 epidsodes patiently waiting for significant action, twists, battles or something but so far nothing has surprised or interested me. So far it has been mainly just royal gossip about house alliances and problems. The performance of Matt Smith as Daemon is a redeeming feature. Threee agonsing birth scenes get a bit repetitive. This is way below the standards of the original GOT series, especially the script which is just lots of discussion of royal house politics. So far there has been 1 unimpressive battle scene. The biggest problem for me is the lack of characters I can really like and support. Also the visuals, cinematography is dull and unimpressive."
"This show is fab so far. Daemon fighting in the battle was epic. Also I like how Daemon keeps on pissing Viserys off with his shenanigans, This shows actually a banger so far, I know the events are moving quickly but it's because we're only following maybe a couple perspectives compared to the numerous perspectives in GOT. I hope this show does well cause so far I'm impressed and I'm happy Daemon is getting the recognition he deserved from the fan's for being one of the best characters from ASOIAF. Ofc I might be biased because the rogue prince have always been one of my favorites, but now when ppl mention Dany, Rhagor, or Jon we can start to see Daemon name pop up as will. Hopefully there's a blackfyre spinoff in the future so that another Daemon can be introduce to the fan's."
"Great opening that reminds us of the golden days of the great scenarios and dialogues of GOT and Vikings (King Ragnar and king Ecbert).I usually, as i did with GOT , prefer to watch any popular show after many years of the first season because i don't have the patience of waiting, so The only failure now is that we have to wait for too long for each episode to be shown and for each season to be on air . I'm afraid it's eight or ten years !! Who knows !!"
"It was good, but I want to feel a stronger connection to the characters. Feel like so far idc who dies.Overall though I am glad that the show is back and I hope that it peaks my interest to keep watching as the first game of thrones did.I feel Game of Thrones was watched for the shock value, but also it's ability to make us fall in love with the characters. So personally I'd like to see more weight given to these characters to actually enjoy this series moving forward. I also feel that it should be a known fact that that is what will make this show last. So please don't drop the ball.Though so far I enjoy it!"
"It took a couple episodes to hook me but i'm in. This will never be GoT but as a revisit to that world it's very good.For comparison. I watched RoP with an open mind and was just bored. It's such a waste of time. No compelling characters or story, no intrigue.HotD has slowly built to a very interesting set of plots and has developed a set of compelling characters. I look forward to each new episode .(as opposed to RoP which i may never watch again).The production looks great. Not quite GoT level but certainly not ""cheap"" as some have felt.I'll continue watching this. Clearly they have a story to tell. If only the makers of RoP could have done the same."
"House of the Dragon is the perfect adaptation for George R. R. Martin's immense world building and lore. It brings life to everything the writer has given us through many books. I see a lot of reviews that this is just a soap opera with dragons and it can't be farther from the truth. Yes, it is about court intrigue and scandals but that is to be expected as it is the main theme of all the stories in this universe.The characters are excellent and the writing and the pacing is just pure perfect. Acting is surprisingly good and the casting is top notch. When I saw that the Velaryons were cast with African-American actors I was very skeptical (due to the original story) but especially Corlys Velaryon exceeded all my expectations.The story is rich, well told and is different from the original series as it takes place around 170 years earlier. Don't expect white walkers and the rest, that is the story of the other series.Honestly, I wish the creative team behind these series had shot the original, at least the last 4 seasons.In summary, House of the Dragon restores the well deserved glory to the A Song of Ice and Fire series after the catastrophe known as the last 4-5 seasons of Game of Thrones."
"I wanted to ignore and skip this series, but I couldn't help it. I will admit, I went in with prejudice caused by the decline in quality of GoT and the disaster that is the 8th season of it, but I must say, House of the Dragon does look intriguing and it does look good. This review will be edited once more episodes are out but right now I dare to hope, that this series would wash away the foul aftertaste of GoT and get me excited for Westeros once more. Having watched episodes 1 and 2, I recomend you give the series a chance. Medling, brutality, nudity and DRAGONS! It is there. As long as the characters keep on behaving consistently and actions would lead to consequences (no deus ex machina) this could be good. Let us see."
"The pilot was really good. Set the tone for the whole show perfectly. Really liked Matt Smith as Daemon Targaryen. Milly Alcock and Paddy Considine's performance were great. Overall a good way to start the spin-off. I think, House of The Dragon has the potential to surpass it's prequel Game of Thrones if they do it correctly. Even though we know how the story end , it would be mind blowing to see it happen on the screen. I hope they will not screw it up like D&D did with Game of Thrones. Anyway, to sum everything up ...The casting is pretty well done. Really love all the actors & actresses and their performances. The plot is great. The timing is nicely done. Overall a great show."
"I adored this show in episodes 1-5. Acting was phenomenal, visually beautiful, albeit too dark. HOWEVER they changed the lead for Rhaenyra in episode 6 and it completely ruined the show. The reason? The new actor has 0 chemistry with Daemon (Matt Smith). They spent 5 episodes building a love story that had some of the most intense chemistry I've seen on screen and then, when they finally get together in episode 6, all of that chemistry completely evaporated. They should have kept Milly at least through the end of the season and aged her up with makeup. Rhaenyra and Daemon's relationship is extremely important in the show. Daemon does all of what he does for his love of Rhaenyra and if we aren't convinced they're passionately in love the story just doesn't work. With the other actress, Milly, we felt how they were in love and were soulmates. It was a very bad mistake to recast her.That said, Paddy Considine is amazing as Viserys. True Emmy material from him and Matt Smith who plays Daemon. Also, the recasting of Alicent is actually well done. Olivia Cooke is very convincing as adult Alicent. I will probably continue to watch but the recast of Rhaenyra was a giant mistake."
"A trash spin-off where time & money could be spent in better use. The ""dragon"" family is uninteresting, predictable and shallow in development and except for the dragons the whole show felt broken, sputtered along, and a snoozefest.It felt at times more like a boring docudrama and if some stuffy scientist came in with talk over narrative I wouldn't have been surprised.Even the fight scenes were half done, though if there is anything good to come from this dismal yawner was the acting by some of the main cast.Sadly the writing, the world, the painting out of Martin's masterful novels, was shockingly unappealing & disappointing."
"PROSExcellent cast, particularly Milly Alcock.Political intrigue, violence and sex.Faithful to Martin's work.S1 vibes with the budget of S8CONSPacing is a little fast.Not as funny as GOT."
Yes I really tried to keep it on the low side. But comeon. More GoT content?My expectations was through the roof. AND IT DELIVERED! From the start too!Its awesome in all the same reasons GoT is.
"I wanted to wait with writing this review till end of this show but this garbage reviews changed my mind. This show is more about few characters which´re at the center of this show. And it´s the best thing about it, there´s great character development, actors are amazing, plot is slow(not really actually) but still entertaining and directing is as perfect as expected from Miquel and crew. The casting director should definitely get a raise, the young and also the older versions of our beloved characters are perfect. So give it a go, it´s like first seasons of GOT but with budget. Now we can only enjoy and hope it´s not gonna end like last time."
"There were scenes I felt like I couldn't look but at the same time I also couldn't look away.There were many moments where you can see that the director put thought into the smallest details, how each scene makes the characters feel and he definitely managed to pass that through the screen.Great shooting angles, in general excellent shots and high level effects.The war scenes were too dramatic for my taste, a lot of dramatic music and slow motion"
"Different in many ways from Game of Thrones but it's nice to have references to the families we got to know in that series.Since this is a different director, and in Game of Thrones there were eight directors, you can understand why it is so different, besides, the current series is more focused on the Targaryen family and less on the 7 kingdoms.In addition, it is important to note that the series starts slowly but that is only because they make sure to tell the story well and not to leave out any details.The more you keep watching it, the better it gets."
"As someone who has read all Fire & Ice media along with other fantasy novels, this is promising much like the start of Game of Thrones and hope it continues.This is leagues better than the last 2/3 seasons of Game of Thrones and in another world compared to the bad adaptation of Wheel of Time and more than likely Rings of Power too. This is the one to watch."
Game of thrones!!! That's all I'm gonna say!!! And WINTER IS COMING!!! This series is already amazing and it's only episode 1. Just please don't ruin it like the game of thrones ending ! 10/10.
"I am still halfway to season 1, and too far from the end of the series, so I might change my review later, but the impression for the moment is this.That being said, I know thatthey may elaborate lots of things through the show, BUT, the show is very rushed!This show should follow GoT, and what made GoT great was the complexity, the details on characters actions to achieve a goal, and when they did the climax, you felt it! They dedicated a whole episode to Battle on the wall, a whole episode for Hardhome, and Battle of the Blackwater bay. They let you feel the rythm and made you part of the story!I got to be honest I did not read Fire and Blood, but I read The World of Ice and Fire, and it was a brief story of Dance of Dragons, also read some stuff and reviews on internet and that's all. But I knew the meanin of the show right from the beginning, and I was eager to know the details of this story. But yet, in just one episode they bury Laena, Aemond rides Vhgar, lost his eye, Rhaneyra makes a plot on Laenor, he ""dies"", came back, etc. It is not that you cannot follow the story, but you can't feel it. And the characters, hope I will change my mind but Emma Darcy and Olivia Cooke doesn't seem to fit into these roles!It is hard to create something that is always going to be compared to one of the greatest tv show ever, but the dedication and the budget of this tv show should've been used more carefully.If GoT were to be created like this, Robb's war would've lasted only for 3 episodes."
"The set's, costumes, VFX , Music and SPECIALLY the acting.Paddy Considine was at his best . Matt smith was superb as well.The character's where build inside the first episode is the plus point from this episode.A good episode with some intense , beautiful and shocking scenes .I totally enjoyed it.Love from India."
"I was happy to see that it failed horribly compared to benchmark created by game of thrones,what a complete waste of time ,me waiting when will it end .one of worst sequels attempted ,confused story lines,immature portrayal of dragons,overall not a good series to spend time on ,the people who have gone through the great series of GOT,and wishing that it would never ended ,compared to this one which is so boring to watch .feels dissatisfied.please if your looking to watch good series ,please go way ,this is not the one,horrible series to watch ,confused director and story .very bad vfx compared to GOT."
"I thought episode 1 was trying for a bit of overall nostalgia or just an ode to Game of Thrones (though not particularly exceptional); more of an attempt to say, ""Yes, we are going to be as focused on gratuitous violence and horrendous evil as Game of Thrones was."" I'd give that episode a lesser rating (6). But still, a very solid beginning.Episode 2, on the other hand (I give it a 9), which is getting lower ratings - no doubt due to the shallower, ""we want gratuitous violence"" crowd - was by far the more intriguing and fascinating episode - demonstrating the mixed moralities of every character. And it really brought out the oncoming force of Rhaenyra.In Game of Thrones (aside from the horrendously failed final season - those two producers should be banned from producing any new TV shows; and the diminished seasons after they moved beyond the books) there were several redeeming characters that drew compassion - the Hound; Jon Snow; Tyrion; etc.It will be interesting if this new series brings out similar redemptive characters or whether every character is ultimately too self-oriented. One of the problems for Martin, as epic a writer as he is, is that his view of the world lacks doesn't quite have the redeeming feature of the likes of Tolkien.But, can't wait for the rest of the season. Solid start."
"Having a devastating end to one of the most loved TV series was heartbreaking for me and many more. The ending to it was bad enough to ruin any re-watch for the series and lowered the expectations for any of successor that was to be rumoured 3 year back. After many try and rejects HBO finally thought to settle for HOT-D and I never thought I would be able to gather strength to watch it. After 3 days I decided to give it a try and I am glad I did it. The show has most of the elements of GOT like A dynasty on brink of imminent destruction, Allies that wait for their chance to get closer to throne, Complicated families and relations, Basically every character that was introduced seems to have an ambition of their own. Cinematography is top notch but the visual effects seems to be off in certain scenes. Rest the Action, goriness, nudity and enigmatic characters won't disappoint you. Please just don't ruin this one for me. I want to it to be even better than the best Prequel ever made Better call Saul."
"This episode has all the game of thrones elements we all love: the cruelness, the unpredictability, the grey characters, good acting and complicated plotlines.This promising first episode, already shows this is not some cheap make over of Game of Thrones, but a sincere game of thrones like tv-series. The game of thrones universe is the same, the time and the actors are different.The only question is, Can they keep up this level throughout the series ?"
"Initially the characters seem a bit weak, but this is the point, as Westeros was at peace for 70 years. Then along comes Prince Daemon, an absolute mad-lad, challenging everyone in marauding fashion. LOVE IT."
"HOTD was good not great up until episode 4, now it's finally hit it's stride to something amazing and even sooner then GOT season 1!Episode 5 is going to be an absolute huge pay off and the rest of the season is going to be absolutely amazing! I haven't been this stoked since GOT season 5 or 6! Literally nothing like it on TV right now and comparing it to ROP unless something drastic happens is laughable.HOTD is beating out ROP in every category except gratuitous use of CGI.If this show goes where I think it's going this might even top GOT... Which I never imagined a spin off could do..."
One of the finest episode for a beginning of a series. Wishing the House of Dragons team a great success ahead. Must watch for everyone. Awesome screen play and great acting and beautiful CGI effect😍❤
"I know by reading reviews that a lot of people were unimpressed by the show and just as many loved it. I am neither here or there. Its not a horrible prequel to a show and I think knowing it was a prequel and not letting GOT be what I went in thinking I was getting is why I didn't hate it. GOT is its own and even a prequel isn't going to rate since its stories may carry the same kingdoms but the characters you loved aren't even a thing here and that will curb how you see it if you go in looking for those same connections. Upside we get to hear more about kingdom's that were mentioned less in the GOT series which, if smart, writers could use to their advantage with this show.So some of the cons and pros..First, casting looks wise for houses is great. Lanisters, starks, Targaryen and others look alot like their heirs from GOT in personality and hair tones.. now moving on..Matt Smith, while not a favorite of mine, is a good actor. The down side here is he is forever in my mind a ""Doctor Who"" so seeing him with long hair my brain tells me this is a result of Doctor who and Legolas having a love child... beyond that forever etched in my mind thought, I will admit that I like Matt Smith in roles where he's psychotic (his face and eyes just sells it), and he plays this part well.As for Princess Rhaenyra, the first few episodes with Milly in the role, was fantastic. She gave the feel for character just the right amount of emotion. I already knew she wanted her uncle the minute he slide the necklace on her, I was like ""yep here it goes"". I don't mind the actress who plays her as older character though she's seems a bit more feeble and less cold as an adult which doesn't quite fit what my mind had been building for this character after watching her in younger form.One review mentions missing the comedian like styling of a Tyroin Lanister type character. This is a sad thing but I think this show is trying for serious. This isn't bad but the cast could use a bit more levity and comic relief which wouldn't hurt.Again not a horrible show, and I may or may not keep watching if a season 2 comes out. My biggest issue is the constant time jumps which gave me whiplash and made it feel rushed. I had just started to really get to know the characters then out of nowhere there was a time jump. It was jarring. Hopefully season 2, if it happens, slows down a bit and let's the cast grow into their characters and allows the audience to build connections to those characters. I think that is maybe the biggest difference between this series and the GOT series (or other great series). Allowing casts and audiences settle into characters in a story helps create connections and resonates in watchers even after the show has ended. TV people often end shows to soon or rush through them which makes a show not only unsuccessful but forgettable."
"I think this serie could even greater than game of thrones, because of the characters, the music, the cost, briefly house of the dragon is great thing was filmed."
"I guess, this show should be very glad to have Rings of power as the main competitor. Comparing to that steaming pile, it indeed looks very good.But judging by its own merits it is pretty meh, and on par with the final season of GoT. It is poorly thought out and lacks in details. No punishment for the stupidity.Lead characters has insane plot armour. I'll give a couple of minor examples, that don't spoil the plot. Daemon wears open helmet on the jousting tourney - at the very list his face should be severely scarred by the lance splinters - nope, not a scratch. Rhaenyra - like a 40kg girl - gets attacked by a wild boar for like 30 seconds - half of her bones should be broken - nah, she is fine. And so on.At the same time background characters are killed with no reasons or consequences at all. The same tourney is a good example - the participants should be very wealthy high profile knights, sons of the most powerful houses of the realm. Like 5 of them got killed, and nobody even mentioned it. And there are more examples of such pointless deaths, that only serve to entertain the audience. Member how GoT brutally killed the leading characters? - look we can do it too, right? Yeah, well, not really.Most of the characters are lame. There are a number of exceptions to that: Otto Hightower and king Viserys did good. And the guy with the injured leg is the highlight of the show, and actually felt like the only true GoT character. The moment, when he talks to Alicent, and his words are absolutely innocent, but imply the worst - is likely the best scene of the series. At the same time Rhaenyra is absolutely unbearable and annoying. Her dumb erratic actions is the main reason of all the troubles. Daemon is not much better.In the end it felt like a chore, and I don't think I'm coming back for the future seasons. All of this characters kind of deserve to die horribly, and I don't care."
"Further to my previous comments, just watched ep 6. Goodness, it just keeps getting worse. GOT was in a different league all together. This is more like a woke, poorly written version. Poor script, bad actors, bad direction, etc. They are trying to be clever with the timeliness but without a solid character buildup or script, it just falls flat.Season 1 ep 1 of GOT had far more in it compared to all thr 6 episodes of this trash.Feel sorry for HBO/Sky Atlantic who must have paid through their noses for the rights.Very poor showI wouldn't be bothered with it anymore and I suspect a lot many would feel the same."
As a fan of Game of Thrones I was cautious going into this first episode blew any fear away and every episode since has been completely amazing. While this series writing might not be quite to the level of peak got it's definitely more action packed with less filler than the original. We have a new set of great in depth character that feel more complex than a lot of the game of thrones characters as this isn't just a story of good and bad for example Starks vs Lannister's or Danny vs Cersei. It lets you as the viewer choose who you support so the line of good and bad is much more thin. So when the action you know this is going to be a treat.Only complaint time jumps are bit Jarring but it far than over makes up for it.Edit
"Now it's over this series is still a 10/10 amazing finale. The people who don't like it are deluded. Daemon and Rhanerya fight is clearly a one time thing and was not a big deal. The man killed his first wife this isn't a fairytale what were you expecting. I believe Daemon is soo angry at rhanerya for not killing Otto while they had the chance and he so angry he strangled her to say wake up also Daemon is power hungry.Rhanerya has always been softer in this show. She didn't kill leanor. So this all makes sense.I believe we will see character development of how rhanerya becomes a cold blooded ruthless beloved leader. That she was remembered as in fire and blood.The change with Aegon was perfect. ""The fact we control the dragons is a illusion""Season finale all the changes were good.My top 3 episodes would be episode 10, episode 8, episode 7"
While I was not a fan of episode 6 and 9 I love the rest of them so much that it's still a 10.
I always kept my expectations low because of wht happened with GOT S 8 though this was with new show runners i still had tht trust issue but i gotta admit when i saw tht first episode everything frm casting to costumes was upto perfection.it literally crushed my expectations now waiting from ep 2.
"I thoroughly enjoyed the pilot episode for this series. I really liked how they referenced the Song of Fire and Ice and Rhaenerys' character came in with a strong and promising potential that is sure to add to the fire that eventually produces Daenerys ""Khaleesi"" Targaryen. Excellent ensemble. It is really exciting and I'm very curious to continue seeing more as the series continues."
"These two Shakespearean ""monsters"" took the whole episode on their shoulders. High promises for a prequel. I would give a 9/10 but let's keep lower expectations in order not be disappointed(for further AD&D info, you don't allow a Thief (Arya Stark) to kill the TRUE FINAL BOSS, a Necromancer (Nightking)). Thus, 8/10."
Even though I've never finished game of thrones I gave this one a go and I have to say I really enjoyed it. The storyline had me lost in a fantasy world and ooops...suddenly it's over and I'm back in my living room! 😁
"Sharp, well-written dialogue filled with poetry, political intrigue and wit? Check.Characters who drive the story forward with their decisions, ambitions, and flaws? Check.A damn good story? Sure looks like it's going to be one.Say what you will about the lackluster later seasons of GOT, but House of the Dragons is absolutely a cut above those disappointments.This show is a time machine, transporting us back to the good old days, to the King's Landing we fell in love with: the one full of schemers and plotters vying for the Iron Throne.For a first episode, the Heirs of the Dragon delivers a captivating hour that sets up an age when dragons dominate the skies, and the Targaryens rule the Seven Kingdoms virtually unchallenged due to their control of such power.The only conceivable possiblity for conflict exist within, and the seeds for that inevitable infighting is sown here.We know the battle for the throne is coming, and we know it will be between Princess Rhaenyra (the newly appointed heir to the throne and potentially Westeros' first Queen ruler) and Prince Daemon, the closest male in the line of succession who has long sought to be King, but is now sidelined.The destination is set, but it is the journey that I am most excited to experience. Game of Thrones hasn't been this good in years."
"Good but not great, though I do see the potential with the characters that have been involved so far. I'm simultaneously watching GoT and HoD so I'm very much comparing the two. Looking forward to the rest of the season."
Now Epi 1 was brilliant one epic oneSure shot season 1 heavy hype for season 2 🔥And Music director another hero !!!Waiting for Epi 2 Rhaenyra Targeryan.
"House of the Dragon delivers a good reintroduction to the world of Westeros even for those jaded from the previous show. House of the Dragon slowly builds up tension, stakes, and action throughout the season. Although it can get of to a rocky start so far it is worth the journey. The only pet peeve being occasionally the CG is questionable. The cast delivers all around, with Matt Smith delivering a captivating performance. His character is a standout and plays into the escalation and sudden bursts of violence that go into making Game of Thrones the beloved franchise that it is. That being said it has not reached the heights game of thrones is known for. It seems to distance itself from the other ugly parts of game of thrones. The ugly character moments, the torture, the subjugation of the disadvantaged, and the sexual violence that plagues this world. It seems that the show wants to have its cake and eat it too. The show can not simply tell us how cruel this world is it needs to show it more often. Although it is not perfect i believe the show provides an entertaining ride and is worth your time. Just set your expectations right."
"I gave it 6 episodes so as not to rush to judgement, but this show fails across the board. Terrible casting, bad writing, bad direction, bad production (so dark!), bad show running, and the worst, most distracting, dumbest wigs on television.They said they wanted to keep the focus internal to the House of Targaryen, but looks like they also decided that should come at the expense of the rest of Kingslanding or Westeros. It's like there's only 100 people in this world, which might be ok, but you have to make at least some of them interesting. As yet, they haven't. These people are 1 dimensional plot devices. They completely lack any kind of wit or charisma and have no depth to them. For instance, why did Alicent marry Viserys? Did she *want* to be queen? We didn't see any kind of ambition to that aim before. Was it because of her father? Duty or fear? Or did she share his ambition? Who knows? He only had about 10 lines up until then. If this was his plot, why did he accept Viserys decision so meekly? All that time in Kings Landing as Hand and he didn't build up any alliance? And what did the people of Kings Landing think? Who knows, who cares, right? Unlike GoT, there's no complex political calculations or repercussions here. And the dress? No need to include any backstory on what that meant or what it started? Ok. Just one example, but the whole show is full of things handled this terribly. 8 hours in and I don't know or care who these people are. Their stories are shallow and most lack consistency or context. It's like 8 hours of ""and then this happened"" about people you don't know at a place you don't work. Boring.Also, what is their point with women in this show? I know GoT got dinged for it's portrayal of violence towards women, but I think HotD is way worse. It's certainly been much more uncomfortable to watch. 6 episodes and 3 gratuitously violent and drawn out birth scenes? AND the casual murder of a wife and bartering off of 10 year old girls as a perfectly acceptable marriage proposals? Doesn't that seem really Extra for 6 episodes? Maybe it reads worse in the post Roe era, but to me this show makes me feel way worse than I ever did with GoT and comes across as exploitive and backwards. ""Our battlefield is the birthing bed""??!? Really? In this story where women were warriors and conquerors in their own right, you chose to ignore that and turn it in to something so reductive? What an ignorant choice. At least GoT was smart about how women approached and gained power in this world. HotD is just gratuitous and dumb. Nothing in their approach makes sense in the story and it's sure not anything I want to watch.The casting too. I like Paddy Constantine and Matt Smith, but they are not Targaryens. Their performance reads second or third string, not people descendant from an immensely powerful dynasty. They can't even carry those wigs (which, to be fair, are the worst wigs in memory). I guess they couldn't find any real blonde actors? Get some people with spark! ( I was thinking Ebon Moss-Bachrach or even Jesse Plemmons as Viserys and someone like Travis Fimmel for Daemon). I don't mind diversity, but having it be the Velaryons does pose a canon problem (Targaryen obsession with their superiority and bloodlines was a big part of their downfall). The actor who plays Corlys also falls flat. True, he's only had about 10 lines, but he doesn't seem dynamic enough for the character. (Try someone like Jude Law or Tom Hardy). He and Paddy also seem too old for their early parts. Young Rhaenera is ok, but they can't seem to decide if she's headstrong and mischievous or reserved and distant. Christian Cole, pretty much everyone on the small council- just completely contrived and forgettable.The writing is superficial and sprawling. None of the pointed wit, strategic viewpoints, or layered characters of GoT, just recounting plot points from the books without adding depth or context. 6 episodes in and it seems like the first 5 we're just spinning wheels. Good writers would have been able to work most of that material in as backstory in order to focus on the story they wanted to tell, but HotD team doesn't seem to know what that story is or have anything interesting to add to it.And on top of it, I can barely see 1/3 or the scenes because Kings Landing is so dark for some reason. There's scenes that I thought were in the middle of the night and then they step outside and it's mid day. Why? By GoT time, Kings Landing had plenty of light in most of the rooms. What happened? It's not winter. They seem to be familiar with the concept of windows. This show cost more per episode than GoT, and yet who knows what they're spending it on. Can't even see most of it, and what I can see looks like GoT knock offs costumes rather than anything opulent or anything that would speak to the power and industry of old Valyria.Whatever. Super fans are giving this a 10, but that's laughable. Maybe a 3 if you're interested in the story. I'm going with a 1 at this point because I haven't found any redeeming qualities and they've seemed to dumb down and ruin a story and world that was already laid out for them. Waste of time."
"I did not have high hopes going into this show. Season 8 left a flaming bag of dog droppings in my mouth so I was understandably hesitant to watch this. Two episodes in and it is a much stronger show than I expected.The cast are talented, the writing is solid, the costumes are well done, the sets are perfectly in line with the original series. If I have one thing to say to HBO it would be: DON'T MESS THIS UP. Seriously, just keep doing what you're doing. Don't start injecting derivative storylines in the plot. Don't change a thing. Don't do what GoT did in Season 8. There's plenty of other depressing things in the world that we can turn to if we want our hopes and dreams crushed, thanks."
"The Casting & their dialogue delivery on point... Cinematography Looked absolutely same as GOT, Same Vibe, Same Feelings.. I have very high hopes with this."
"Hollywood wokemeter 1/10 = Score 9/10.Show is awesome, not as good as first seasons of GOT, but still one of the best shows currently running. Most actors and actresses are really well chosen, everyone has a good non-political and no ""virtue signaling"" characteristics. Writers are on point and should feel proud about themselves of writing something good and awesome.Earlier episodes had some cheap CGI to be honest. At least on later episodes it all got better and better, dragons looked awesome the more season progressed.Really looking forward to seeing season 2 of the show. One of the only ""current spin-offs"" that actually has any talented writers behind it, not some rutine paycheck collectors..."
"It is absolute perfection. I cannot describe the feeling it gave me. The visuals, the story, the dragons, the music, the dialogue, the acting, the fear that something is about to happen, and oh my god the return to the universe of Game of Thrones. I got goosebumps in about three scenes and cried at the start. Everything feels so fresh and sensational. I feel so lucky to be alive."
"If the creators' goal was to make the audience feel like it was back to watching GoT again, I think they succeeded with the first episode. While not as good as the pilot, GoT also had worse season premiers. The quality of the show seems to rightly fall in that 8.9 range where a ton of almost great shows pile up. Whether it deserves to be in the 9 club will friend on the rest of the season. I do think it could benefit by taking the graphics a little more seriously. The dragon and aerials of King's Landing in the beginning were pretty bad. It doesn't detract from the story, but it detracts from the overall show because it indicated the level of detail, quality, and funding that HBO cares to invest. Hopefully now with the positive reactions HBO will put forward the effort to show the audience that it wants HotD to be as great as GoT."
Instantly emotionally invested !Setting myself up for another potential heartbreak I guess.Great first episode. Hope the rest of the season is equally great if not better.Cannot wait for next Sunday.
"Starts off really well with the first 3-4 episodes, then stalls and becomes this deadly boring ""generations family drama"" for most of the rest of the season, only to finally start getting interesting again near the end. Hopefully, this is a pre-cursor to what season 2 will be like.The change of actors was also of varying success. Milly Alcock was perfect as the young Rhaenyra, whom she played with great conviction and subtlety. I really can't say that of Emma D'Arcy, who seemed misplaced in the role at best.Other than that, directing and production was generally very convincing (entirely unlike that other competing fantasy series that came out at around the same time). My biggest gripe is about the story itself, which seems it was written more as a historical record rather than being meant for an interesting drama."
"This seems on the same level as GOT. It somehow captures the same style of the show but I'm a different tone, more vivid and strong dialogues and cinematography. Exactly what made GOT earlier seasons the best TV has ever produced."
"As a Game of Thrones fan, the first 8 episodes of this show were thoroughly a let down, with the 9th and 10th actually being interesting. But considering all episodes, HOD lacked the frivolity and the characters of the original. There's really no one here to like or get attached to. It seems more like a book report on the first 193 years before Game of Thrones than a stand alone prequel. So I almost don't think IMDB should allow ratings based on 1 or 2 episodes, which swings the vote so far that there's really no point in other people giving a rating. This show definitely doesn't rise to the level of a 8.5 or 9."
"This show is poison to the medium of television. Almost every bad lesson learned from cinema over the past decade is on display here.Problem 1) Gratuitous CGIFor all the money they've thrown at this show, the CGI sure is rough. Every shot of the Red Keep, every shot on a boat, every combat shot, all coated in a thick layer of D-grade green screens. They even digitally edit the actors' faces - see Viserys on his deathbed for an abysmal face-swapping demo.This show will age poorly; it is exclusively a product of its time. In contrast, Game of Thrones still looks stellar a decade after release because of the practical set design and tightly controlled use of CGI.Problem 2) DialogueRemember, in Game of Thrones, when Tyrion would tell a joke at an inappropriate time? When Jon Snow delivered a rousing speech? Or maybe when The Hound told someone to **** off? Those moments landed because the characters were compelling speakers. They had established tones, cadences, and vocabularies appropriate for their social standings and personalities.House of the Dragon has precisely one tone: pompous, humorless spiel. The characters are exposition-delivering robots, mindlessly prattling on about whatever happened mere minutes before the current scene. Everyone waits politely for other characters to stop speaking so they can deliver their own monologues about nothing. No wit, no charm, no excitement, just stunted olde-English word salad.I'll leave this section with some proof by way of a totally natural line of dialogue from Rhaenys in 109: ""I will do you the considerable courtesy of assuming there is a good reason for the outrage of my treatment here this morning""Problem 3) Shot composition and set designLet's talk about color palettes. Game of Thrones is a fine example of color done right. Each region has its own color temperature and set trappings - the North, stark white and icy blue, contrasts sharply with the lush heat and warm hues of King's Landing. The Wall is a dark and imposing structure, lit only by torches straining against wind and snow, while the Eyrie towers above the clouds, filling with a cold natural light.Compare those locations with House of the Dragon. One candle-lit chamber bleeds into the next with no distinguishing features. Nobody leaves the castle interior, and when they do, they're immediately pulled back in to the same handful of dark, cramped sets. A nauseating blue and orange color palette permeates the entirety of the show, including the rare exterior scenes.The lifeless sets are matched by equally tepid camera work. Characters do not travel from point A to point B, they materialize where needed, camera already in place. Nearly every scene begins with the characters anchoring themselves to the set by sitting down or staring out a window. Blocking is nonexistent. Establishing shots are a luxury here, presumably because the sets don't offer enough detail beyond a cursory glance around the room. Action sequences are equally spartan, with awkward editing and shaky shots of what should be clean sword-on-sword action.If you doubt any of this, just scrub through the last few episodes. See if you can tell from the thumbnails when one scene ends and another begins.At the end of the day, I'm left wondering where all the money went. Weak writing, weak performances, weak visuals... what happened?"
"It was a great series that I waited for a long time. The events were unrelated because of the many time intervals, but it is a prelude to great parts. There is a problem in understanding the many time mutations. You may not see the development of the characters, and because they are They don't stay long because of the old age of the actors in real life. I wish for other parts of the same greatness or more. I enjoyed it a lot. I wished it would not end and stay every week. I wait for another episode. The actors were creative. Matt Smith and Aye. Finally, I thank you for completing the speech. Greetings, Amir, in the name of his farewell."
"For the people saying there are no likable characters, character development takes more than a single hour in a pilot episode. I actually thought Matt Smith was fantastic as Damon; violent and aggressive, but with a clear and deep love for his family. We'll see how the story plays out, but for a pilot, I found it gripping. Of course, you have the same brutality that made GOT so watchable. I think this has great potential."
"Westeros is back! The void left behind by Game of Thrones has been filled by a worthy successor(read predecessor). The politics, backstabbing, intrigue and of course, the sex, all make a glorious return. The onset of a civil war and a resulting power struggle are apparent. The ensemble cast are very good. This feels and looks a lot like Thrones but in a good way. Fingers crossed it turns out like the earlier seasons instead of the latter ones."
"In an era full of spin offs and great failures, like Lord of The Rings series, House of the Dragon is quite interesting, even it is far from GOT quality in this first season, but still quite interesting to keep you engaged on it's whole first journey.In my opinion the series starts slows but gets on track around episode 4-5, where the script gave me everything what I was looking for. I was not expecting another Game of Thrones, in a good way.The cast is pretty good, enough to forget all the characters from the original series but comparing some parelelism between all the members of the houses it's even in some aspects superior.The script is quite predictable at the beginning and not as risky as Game of Thrones, but it has really well development idea, and looks like the writers knows where to go.So, overall great promising great season with its ups and downs, but overall great on action, grittines, gore, passion and originality keeping in mind its not easy, as Game of Thrones explored previously almost everything before.Waiting for season 2."
"Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon are two different breeds of cat. If GoT is a lion, then HotD is a leopard. The lion is more majestic but runs the danger of being more cartoonish than the down-to-earth leopard. HotD is a detailed treatment of the potential difficulties involved in the transfer of power when the monarch dies. As an example of those difficulties, consider the historical conflicts in England between King Harold and William the Conqueror, Empress Maud vs. King Stephen, Richard III and the boys in the Tower, Lady Jane Grey, etc., as well as the several Wars of Succession on the Continent. It gets even more interesting when leprosy (remember King Baldwin of Jerusalem?) is involved. It is refreshing to see these historical details dramatized. The big message of both GoT and HotD is to beware the potential dangers of a white-haired ruler. Beyond that, the HotD cinematographer has taken the use of natural light, including candles, in interior scenes to a new level.For the many critics who think HotD is boring, I suggest a thought experiment. Compare HotD with a biopic of your own life. Which is more boring?"
"It's not as good as Game of Thrones at its height (Season 1-3), mainly because the characters and story are just less interesting and exciting. The scenario is much more calm in this series, being that the family that we follow are established and uncontested rulers, unlike the volatile situation of the original Game of Thrones, which created so many intrigues, betrayals, and wars.That said, it's still an 8/10 show. The production values are quality and through the roof, unlike Amazon's Rings of power (where Amazon fumbled the ball badly). HBO took this show seriously and did not just make an aftershow of the original one.You have the same quality atmosphere, cities, props, costumes, as the original show. In fact it is probably better than the later seasons of GOT.Plus, the show is overall enjoyable especially for those of us that find themselves entertained by the Blonde Scandinavian like Targaryen dynasty (and I imagine many of us love this House and are sold on the show just for that alone, and Dragons).Truth be told, let's just be honest and say that House Targaryen + Dragons + more Game of Thrones is an immediate minimum 8/10. Thank you HBO. In this boring world full of Amazon and Disney low value, this is a breath of fresh air."
"I loathed the terrible, rushed last episodes of the final season of GoTh; they and Martin the Sloth turned me against the franchise. I also am beyond sick of race-swapping and female-good/male-bad themes and the whole woke cult appropriation and ravaging of the works of their betters. But I read that Martin maybe, maybe could redeem his work with HotD. So I watched Episode 1.First, the race-swapping here is limited and plausible: someone dark skinned from some country in Essos has married into the inbred albino ruling clan. There might even be an interesting love and/or political story here. Second, the rather unattractive tomboy princess Rhaenyra is probably in deliberate contrast to the goddess Daenerys, and she doesn't seem any more strong-willed than most other rich/powerful girls. Rhaenyra's situation certainly has precedent: Matilda in the Anarchy in England and Normandy; and the power struggles of the two Marys, Elizabeth, and the forgotten Jane--and the men who wanted to use them. Thus I am glad that the two factors that would have ruined this series for me are not here.However, Episode 1 has problems. It seems less like GoTh and more like dozens of fantasy-world B films of the 80's and 90's. A lot of things (like the laughably bad wigs or plastic armor or uninspired architecture or even the iffy CGI dragons) seem a little cheap. Most of the characters--so far--are not especially well-cast or (worse) interesting. And where are the Heroes? I don't see Rhaenyra rising to the level of Arya, and hope that she isn't supposed to be a subversion of The Male Hero. If Daemon is going to be The Villain, he needs one or more heroic rivals.I am going to be cautiously optimistic that the lack of woke continues and that future episodes will overcome this rather weak start. 6 stars (with a potential for 8)"
"Do not expect GOT 2.0. There are no carbon copies of characters here. The story is focused on the domestic rather than sprawling from place to place with multiple storylines. So much the better.HOTD is less like GOT, and more like The Crown, Succession, or I, Claudius. While there's sex and gore, on the whole HOTD is more elevated than GOT.Like The Crown and I, Claudius, there are time skips and cast changes. It's not like GOT where it's a linear and continuous storyline. Nothing inherently wrong with this, but just expect a different kind of storytelling.The dragons and other CGI look amazing. Unlike GOT, the dragons are given distinct appearances and personalities. You get to feel for them.The acting is much more serious than GOT, helped by the fact that many of these actors primarily acted in theater.Those who were into GOT for the action, explosions, and set pieces from the latter seasons will be disappointed. Those who loved GOT for the early seasons' politicking and scheming and power plays will love HOTD."
"After I watched the first episode, I can say that this could look very close to the original series.The first episode didn't give us an epic opening, as some of the reviewers would have liked, and that's why they give a bad ratingBut you have to wait for at least the first 5 episodes to make a good judgement.The casting may not be as strong as in GOT, but hey, some of them will become real stars after the first season! I think they should be given a chance."
"House of the Dragon is just a pale prequel to the GOT series. It tries to use its scaffolding but fails to fill it with anything of substance. Shallow character development and dialogue. The plot is as complex as that of a cheap soap opera. It tries to shock with graphic violence and cruelty, and it's all it actually achieves. What a wasted opportunity. That said, the cinematography and special effects are fantastic.House of the Dragon is just a pale prequel to the GOT series.

"There's a possibility that this serie will be like Got.I think Here some old mistake solved & George R. R Martin will be a major part of this work.Good luck to HBO, all stuff & fans.Enjoy in th1 season of House Of The Dragon. ðŸ’™"
"Wow I enjoyed every minutes and seconds I missed these great beginnings! Gore, Violence, Battles and sex.Episode one was everything I could have ever hoped for and more, well written, beautifully cinematography and dialogue costume's everything is perfectCan't wait for the next episodes!!!!!!!!!"
"The characters are less when compared to got. I'm not certain of if and how story and characters can dwell as much as got did. Pretty sure this will not go more than 4 seasons. It lacks the fun element which Tyrian brought in got.Still I would say the first season is better than that of got. But got chose slow but diverse character development while house of dragons chose fast and limited. The time jumps within series were too fast, I miss the young rhenerya.I hope I connect with the characters as much as I did during got. The bars are way too high. But I hope they break with this series. :)"
"The series may at first seem like a weak wanna be of the original but if viewers are patient enough, after episode 6 the storyline gets real exciting and by episode 9 you will be fully sucked in by the magical world of the Game of Thrones again craving for more and more and more. The story just starts out with Season 1 and so far, it is steadily beating the Lord of the Rings show with its storyline. It has strong characters, powerful scenes, and almost all the elements making a good fantasy show-misterious prophecies, dragons, and a royal drama with the well known medieval charm of the original series.Great start of another hit series just as good as the original!"
"I still have trauma from GoT S8. I simply cannot bring myself to care or theorize about a show when writers are so incompetent. However this is not the case here. There's no ""the message"" west coast politics that make recent shows stink. What happens in this show is basically taken from the history of england. Characters are complex, the main young female character is extremely likeable (Alcock) and the male characters are not bumbling and stupid, and different from GoT. The writers try to convey the ""this is the peacetime empire and the men are soft"" and that goes through flawlessly and contrasts beautifully with GoT where the men were pretty tough.Know that unlike got the entire story of the show is out so refrain from reading it."
"Already watched first episode of House Of The Dragon.... Fell like GOT vibe.... Nostalgia BGM,,,Superb Cinematography,Nice Plot. Waiting For Mad King and his Daughter Danny(i know that far way). But i can't wait."
"Whether the soundtrack, the pandering, the writing or the acting, this show is trash in comparison to GoT. My favorite part of the show was the final credits because that meant it was over. No, this show is not a masterpiece, no this new Littlefinger-esque character is not nuanced nor is he interesting. This is what happens when talentless Hollywood writers have no source material (I'm aware a book exists, however there is very little dialogue). 7/10 is enough, but some of the VFX were alright.This was truly such a disappointment, and it speaks to our society that so many found it enjoyable."
"House of the Dragon dives back into the world of ice and fire, around 150 years prior to the events of Game of Thrones, when the Targaryen dynasty was still strong with an abundance of dragons at their disposal. But an unclear succession might endanger all of that...Let me put this straight: The show is great and I am so happy about that.It is a brave show to make too because a lot of time jumps forces it to almost restart several times, which is not easy to pull off but the show runners succeeded. After the biggest time jump it took me some time to get back into it but generally I never lost track or interest, nevertheless I hope (and think) that this will no longer be the case in season 2.Of course there is a crisis looming but we can see the height of a dynasty and a realm in order, where things like court proceedings happen as they are supposed to and not in crisis-mode. In GoT we only saw glimpses of that in season 1, so that is a relatively new perspective, which I liked.Generally I liked almost everything: The characters, the story, the dialogues, the music by the great Ramin Djawadi, who returned from GoT and the visuals. I try to avoid trailers and other press material but from the little bit I saw, I was worried about the look of some Targaryens, which seemed a bit fake but either my vision was skewed or they ramped it up in post production because this was absolutely no issue.I especially want to point out what I think the biggest strength of the show is: The very human side of it. This was already the best part of GoT and I am happy that they again layed a focus there. All characters have understandable motivations and no one is overly evil or perfect, all the interhuman relationships feel natural, dynamic and important to the story. In one aspect it even surpases GoT imo and that is the contradiction of human and political relations. Let me explain what I mean by that: All to often in shows like this the characters are simply embodiments of their position, the shady advisor is always plotting, the overlooked heir is constantly sabotaging the current king etc. But it should not be forgotten that a court is a pretty enclosed circle of people who form relationships, which might not fit with their political one. In HotD this is done beautifully, there are people who should act cooperatively or at least peacefully but because they personally detest each other this is hard for them to do, as well as people who have a kind of friendship between them but the reality of their political situation pits them against each other. The strains and dilemmas the persons are left with because of that are amazing in this season.Not everything is perfect tho, I especially missed propper consequences sometimes. For breaking the codes of chivalry or other things that are morally ambiguous at best, consequences are lacking or are only half-backed more than once. Sometimes the explanation that it wore off over the course of the latest time jump works semi-satisfying but at other times it does not.There was also one irrational decision bothering that has to be made so the plot can happen. They come up with an explanation for it later, which was very important for the show and I think the explanation largely works but it is still not ideal.HotD is different from GoT because it is much more focused on one main plot with subplots instead of having what felt like dozens of plots going on at the same time but that does not make it less worthwhile in any way and I felt back at home in Westeros. In GoT I was even more captivated after season one, which, in combination with the small issues I described, prevents HotD from netting the full points but they are well deserved nine points and if you are unsure whether you should trust the world of ice and fire again after the ending of GoT, I think that you should, the show is great."
"8.9 stars, thats elite, and this show is not. THE BAD: The majority female cast is a good shift for Hollywood and equality, but unfortunately in my opinion NONE of them have any drawing power. Bunch of cry babies who don't know how to play ""The Game"". Cersi for all her faults was such a captivating draw, amazing caracter, she was the villain you came to love. None of the women in HOTD come close and the wimp king and other guys aren't any better. THE GOOD: Still it is an entertaining show, graphics are good, it does have a decent GOT feel, and is definitely worth watching. I just don't understand such a high star rating is all."
"I can look past excessive time jumps and repeated use of childbirth to ruin women's lives...but I can't get past the inability to actually SEE the show! Watching episode 7 like it's an audio book! I'm only mildly interested as it is...but the lack of lighting is about to be a deal breaker.It's fun to hear about some of the other houses though... and while it's rightfully centered on the house of dragons, it seems that that focus might lead to boredom of the show more quickly.Overall I probably wouldn't bother watching more on my own - but husband is willing to give it the season, he's kinder than I am."
"Absolutely loved it. The cinematography, acting, costume, plot, pacing etc were fantastic. I think the dragons could use a little work but no reason to lose a star in my opinion. I can see that they clearly went for more variety in design and there were more to make, but hopefully with subsequent episodes or seasons they will only improve. The burden of being a woman in this time was clearly communicated without being contrived. It felt genuine and not a case of modern identity politics making its way into fantasy which I appreciate. Looking forward to more episodes."
.. But now I felt I had to. Opening episode was bloody and brutal and sucked me in almost immediately. (GOT was more complex with so many characters and took a bit more time to understand the whole universe).I am trying my best not to compare this to GOT. But I am thrilled! And impatiant to wait for the rest of The episodes.Great start. (Would love to binge watch though!)
Brilliant start to a great story. I must admit I was a little worried about the casting but when you think of the type of person king viserys is all my worries went away. Matt smith was another worry but again perfect casting. I forgot he was doctor who instantly.If you have read the books and know some of the story then you will know how amazing this period of Westeros history is.The places are the same with some differences but all the houses are different. I hope we see more of the houses we know as the series progresses.
"It's unavoidable to compare this show with GOT, however do not jump the gun yet.HOTD as I see it is about vicious politics for the throne in season 1 within a house unlike GOT. I wanted to see this with least expectations and more importantly how targaryens paved their downfall.Takeaways:1. With the incredibly long lineage for the targaryens, a time jump was a necessity. Hope more time jump follows in the upcoming seasons and ends with Robert's rebellion. Although I highly doubt it.2. Season 1 had a pretty decent introductions to house Targaryen and valaryon, the oldest we knew from books.3. It did draw lot of similarities between the dragons and the targeryans. Both of them can be good, bad and sometimes uncontrollable.4. There is always a little finger to light the fire.Open ends:1. GOT had a lot of character introductions in season 1 and opened the perspective. It's missing here. Most of it are up to our imagination.2. The relationship between hightowers and Targaryen's are not properly established as they did with valaryons.3. Killing of characters did not create an impact as there was no proper connect between the audience and the characters.4. All these chaos because viserys mistook Alicent for rhaenyra in his death bed. Instead alicent could have gone on war directly with Rhaenyra for rightful heir to the throne. Childhood friendship aside.These are just for season 1. But yes I'm invested in this."
"Being an older watcher ðŸ˜Š was pleased with the plot, moved along well certainly be waiting for more episodes. Costumes were great and dragon not to computerised!"
"From an extra who was in Game of Thrones and one of the cancelled prequels I have no allegiance to this prequel whatsoever but by god they've done it again! It was brilliant! Thrilling to be immersed in Westeros again, can't wait to see the next episode!"
"I was looking forward to this series. Having enjoyed Game of Thrones a lot (yes, even the last season) I just couldn't wait to return to Westeros and beyond for more fantasy drama.The first episode was very promising. Great writing, well acted and impeccable set and costume designs. Matt Smith is a great baddy and Paddy Considine carries his part with great grandeur. Newcomer Milly Alcock is a great addition and she delivers what her part needs and more.But 6 episodes in, I am getting more disappointed. And I think it is because of the time gaps between episodes. They skip years in between. Therefor you miss a cliffhanger at the end of the episodes. And between episode 5 and 6 there is even a gap of 10 years, so they had to recast the younger actors for older ones. And now you meet people for the first time and are expected to remember their character's whole experience and evolvement from the previous episodes. But that doesn't work, you start at 0 with new characters, so you have to give them a lot more development quickly to get connected to them.For instance, in episode 6, we have the new wife of Daemon. In previous episodes she was briefly shown as a child, and now she is married to him, with children, for 10 years. She is a grown woman and not happy. So she decides to kill herself by means of dracarys. And that should be a heartbeat stopping moment, but I just didn't care, I just met the woman! I really felt, whatever.It is really difficult to keep connected to characters if you have these big gaps of time between episodes. Remember that movie Boyhood? Shot over 12 years, several scenes every year. It was well made, but also there, you didn't connect because in the next scene the drama of the previous scene is already solved, because it's a year later.I will continue watching this though, because I hope it will get better. And for the quality of the acting and production, I will keep my rating on a reasonable level. Maybe I will adjust, maybe not. 7/10."
I'd loved the story of the Targaryen on the blood and fire books; you get to know all the details that the narrator don't get to know of. Sadly that means that you get to know how the story ends. I don't understand people disappointment; I mean there's a book the story is already there. I love the cast and all those Westeros details. We see all the dragons that are in the Targaryen mythology; you discover the true nature of their motto; the glory days of this family and understand where Daenerys come from. After the awful ending of got; this feels like a revindication. To all the people that's calling it a soap opera; I mean the original GOT is based on an actual petty fight between 2 English medieval families; so it's basically the same.
"House of the Dragons, no matter how many CGI dragons it has to offer, will not revive the fire in the hearts of Game of Thrones enthusiasts.Nothing new. Just a brand. Quality without that special spark..."
"The prequel to Game of Thrones (GOT) has arrived. This version takes place 172 years before the first series and focuses on the Targaryen line of succession: a male heir vs. Female heir. Go figure, medieval monarchies just have not gotten the memo on equal rights - Don't they realize it's 2022?House of the Dragon is not bad compared to 'Rings of Power' - a very low bar indeed - but it is a pale reflection of the original: It lacks teeth; it's tame; it feels more like a history lesson than Game of Thrones. Frankly, House of Dragon reflects the wave of political correctness that has taken over Hollywood. The show has race swapped white characters; while the show also has a contrived focus on childbirth scenes and tends to push female characters at the expense of most of the male characters - Daemon is the only male character remotely interesting. To make matters worse, the characters talk like people from 2022 dressed in costumes.Grades:Casting: Grade D+. Actors do not reach the quality of the original series. Casting reflects the latest Hollywood tiresome obsession: racial quotas and affirmative action type casting - when they ignore the source material. It's a distraction for purely ideological, not artistic reasons.Story: Grade C. The story feels like an Eilzabeth the Tudor queen period piece (with a little Richard III and Hamlet mixed in.) The original Game of Thrones had fantastic elements, iconic characters, and engrossing plot twists: House of the Dragon is mundane in comparison.Production: A. Sets, CGI, costumes are HBO quality. Slightly inferior to the original, but still pretty good.Overall: C-. This series could have been much better: The show runners were clearly terrified of criticism from the twitter crowd directed toward Game of Thrones regarding race, women's roles, nudity, sex scenes, etc. - but apparently gore and gratuitous violence is still o.k. House of the Dragon deserves a rating of about 6 or 7. I rated it 4 because the inflated ratings of 10 skew the results."
"House of the Dragon delivers on the best aspects of Game of Thrones and does so in a way that invites new fans to the series without the barrier of understanding GOT lore. The only thing I don't like about the show is that Milly Alcock won't be on it anymore after episode 6! All of the actors are great, but Milly steals every scene she is in. I'm glad Ryan Condal recognized how great of a character Rhaenyra is and chose to center the plot of the show almost entirely around her. Daemon is also very well written. There are times times when he says or does something absolutely irredeemable and you hope he dies the next episode, and then when you watch the next episodes it is impossible NOT to root for him (you know the fight sequence I am thinking about). Condal has proved he can make incredibly likable characters, spectacular fight sequences, and riveting drama."
"HBO knows how to make a show.House of The Dragon pilot delivered. Perfect production design, visuals, etc to scratch that epic fantasy itch.Ramin brought the god tier score as usual.Went from skeptical to skeptically optimistic."
"Fire, Blood, Scheming and Plotting, Violence, Dragons, Solid Characters defined the journey of Game of Thrones (I am not entirely counting out the final season). #HouseOfTheDragon opens strong, like we have come to expect of anything #gameofthrones. There are strolls in the gardens, bickering council members, scheming women, death, flying and screeching dragons - all of which blend well into the events of the season opener. The actors from Paddy Considine to Matt Smith to Rhys Ifans to Milky Alcock to Eve Best shine throughout the first episode."
"Compared to GOT's first episode, this one was a bit boring at the start. But hopefully it will be interesting in the future.Other than that the acting and VFX are excellent, as well as a good balance of tempo, nudity, and violence. The cinematography is also superb."
"Woow!! This show is Amazing, The true successor of GOT. Don't miss it. And don't listen to the haters. This series, like GOt, can excite us for years to come. It can even be better than GOT. In my opinion, even though season one was not finished, it was even better than expected. Well done to all involved in this show, it was great. You're perfect. It is very difficult for a spin-off to be better than the original series. I think the dragon house will be better than GOT. Just be patient and you will see. Again, I emphasize that you should watch the series and enjoy it without preconceptions. Love from Iran. I use this opportunity and tell all those who see my message, please don't leave us Iranians alone, right now as you are reading my message, we are left alone under the repression of the regime."
"Spoiler Free reviewThis is everything I wanted, and more! I'm so glad that it was kicked off right from the start! The brutality was amped up!!!! I can already tell Matt Smith's Daemon and Milly Alcock's portrayal of Rhaneyra are amazing thus far. It's a fire breathing breath of fresh air. So lovely to return to the world of GoT."
So far the show is pretty dang good all things considered I am excited to see where the show goes I think it's gonna be pretty bad ass. Daemon by far is the best character in the show. It's been a very good build and I have been very entertained by it. So glad GOT is back. Dragons are great first two episodes and I am pumped for more. I really hope that the writers of this show learned their lesson from the ending of Game of Thrones that last episode in that last season was pretty dang disappointing. I'm glad I didn't stick through it over the last 10 years and binge wash at the last year but that was pretty disappointing as far as the ending goes. How can you do that to John snow? How can you screw over Denares like that?
"This is a decent show in its own right. The acting is decent, the casting is decent, the story is decent, the directing is decent, the writing is decent. There is nothing really bas about this show, there is just nothing great about it.There are no characters that inspire me to root for them. There are no relationships that are particularly interesting or captivating.I have found myself fast forwarding at times through episodes just to get to something interesting.It's almost as though every episode is just a meh episode of a good show. I find myself waiting for the good part that never comes."
No spoilers here. This is going to be short and crisp
1) HOTD is for all - GOT & Non GOT folks.2) The prequel is brilliantly displayed with no hangovers from GOT.3) As a person who has read the book; this is what I have been hoping for.4) For people who are trying to avoid disappointment of S8 GOT - try watching She Hulk ðŸ¤£
5) The visual effects are fantastic and will take you to a different realm all the more.6) The characters are fresh with new faces; calls for boldness.7) Enjoy the show with a clean slate.8) Welcome to the world of Dragons and Targareans!!!
Overall I only started watching this cause it is game of thrones and the first 2 episodes were soft but interesting enough to have me tune back in for episode 3.I really wish they had less screen time on the King and more time on the crab feeder and the war.As it stand my only interest is Daemon Targaryen. Who confirms this in episode 3.Overall I tuned in cause this is GoT not as good as the first show but good enough to tune back in.Rhaenyra Targaryen does peak my interest but time will tell. She is interesting at times but off at others.CGI is OK but far from perfection as I said I tuned in and kept watching cause it was GoT but overall they have done enough to keep me tuning in for the next episode each week.
"GOT started off with an explosion of myriad characters, each bringing their own uniqueness to the table, each equally important in furthering the course of the plot with equal importance, from rob stark, sansa, John snow, jeoffrey, cersei, tyrion... to daenerys, jorah, jaime. Even samwell and hodor played more than mere second fiddle.This fails in its expectation to live upto its hype with only one central character and others revolving around it with lesser importance. The excessive debauchery and revelry that might have appealed to many people too, have been moderated as has the violence and gore. To keep it short, this show poses no potential threat to rival or dethrone Game of Thrones.Edit 09/25/2022:"
"Episode 6 and done! Gave it 6 eps, 6 dreary episodes to prove its mettle, but it seems to offer nothing more than endless blabbering and palace politics. Theres nothing intriguing going on here and the show just jumped 10 years and continues to trudge in a vacuum. Basically its too predictable now."
"This show from the very beginning reminds the earlier episodes of GOT,I would say this is NOSTALGIA at its best,"
"Very well made,this show is just extraordinary. Shows the Targaryen ways which was expected and the cast is amazingly put together.Fire will Reign! Dracarys."
"I tried really hard to hate this show; I usually despise prequels as that really can't add much to the overall story.But then I heard about Matt Smith. And I have always loved; and will love him; and he absolutely made this show my favorite thing.It's so well written and characters are fleshed out. And I'm happy to see sex scenes that have more meaning and not just lust.The holding hands + forehead touches were my peak happiness. God bless you Mr. Matt Smith.Yes it does feel different from GoT. I have not read the books but this feels like a Romantic Drama. With politics. And I think people struggle with it have 1 central storyline vs. GoT having multiple. This is not about having a ""favorite character"", all it's focus is on Rhaenyra.Highly highly recommend. I can't wait for the rest of it."
"I feast on the tears of the haters. Dear lord on the negative comments haha. I thought the casting was good, the music great (actually prefer this theme over GOT). The first episode had good pacing to move the story to where it needed to be but I would've preferred a more obvious cliffhanger as to keep us engaged. I'm excited to see where it goes and will update review once season is done."
Review after Ep. 3:
"So far, the show seems true the book, although the story itself contained excerpts and not alot of very descriptive information regarding certain things. I think they did a good job trying to tie in the events so far. I do wish that they slow down some things though. The Stepstones battle was well done but it was unbelievable that two years had past & I believe GoT did good with demonstrating the length of time between events using more than one episode (S1-S5). I feel that they could take their time with this story. Hopefully as the season progresses we can spend a bit more time with the characters and the writers could continue to demonstrate their humanistic traits via interactions with other characters and events. Overall its going good so far..Review after Ep. 1:"
"HOTD delivers everything that we would expect from the GoT universe. Perhaps it would take a second watch to digest everything because this episode had a lot going on. Having read the books, I feel that this story on the visual, theatrical level had a lot to make up for and they did, the production and cinematography was well done, the editing was very GoT like and blended very well. The actors may take some getting used to as they are all new to us in this world but I believe they all delivered. This show is also not for the light hearted, you must understand the references to time periods, themes, just straight drama. A very intriguing story that makes the mind wonder and the wonderful Dragons are just the icing on the cake."
"Been waiting for years, and it as worth it. This show will be the best for the coming years. The fist episode has so many betrayals, and this is just the start."
"The first episode was truly phenomenal. I missed this world so much, and the Targaryen family as well, and the show does not disappoint so far. The dragons are done beautifully, and I can't wait to see what this show has in store."
"Just ignore the hyped 10 star reviews. This is not Game of Thrones. House of the Dragon is not great yet, but isn't bad either. We'll see.It's a solid start for a series and the production quality is just as fine as GoT, but it's still unclear there this is going.GoT had a lot of story elements left out from the books, and right now it doesn't look like House of the Dragon is picking up on any of those fantasy elements, and just sticks to intrigue and power themes we all have seen enough of in GoT.Hope there will be more to see than the plain old queen and her brother storyline."
"Let's play the GoT Comparison game: I think the first seasons of GoT were not its best (nor its worst, of course): Too much useless tits, useless blood, useless aggressions... They threw a lot at the wall to watch what would stick. But by the time of HotD, they already knew that. HotD isn't clear of all these things, but they now have a purpose - and that, in a nutshell, is what this show is about.'House' follows but a single plotline, compared to GoT's complex, multi-theatre drama, and it takes a ""fast slowburn"" approach, leisurely pacing thought years of events. It's quite a masterclass in storytelling we've got here.And that's what makes this show so captivating: The slightest changes in one actor's characters, the alliances, the treasons - because it's based on real, timeless storytelling values, great actor direction, and efficient cinematography. With the first five episodes I watched, the show sure earned its dues.A last word on 'wokeism': It is not a woke show, and gahd knows how much I hate these - just check out some of my reviews. The black actors are a whole House clan, not just a character here and there among whites, which makes it very plausible, and GRR Martin is alright with it. Yes, there are 'strong females', but these can also be wrong, or killed, and they are given no idiotic free passes like beating up 3-4 armored men twice their size - they are no Mary-sues here (much less than in GoT in any case - yeah I'm looking at ya, Arya Stark), just hard-headed women like there are in our world.So in conclusion, HotD is a simplified, experienced successor to his much larger GoT parent, one that will satisfy greatly written and acted drama fans, instead of throwing away eye candy over more mediocre, woke content like some contemporary shows do."
"My whole review is based on the comparison between GOT and the prequel, as this series is not a standalone production, whatever we see is compared in our heads automatically.GOT had a great plot, too many angles and complexity, it had the power struggle, the crazy rulers , mysterious white-walkers, the wall and people beyond it... the progressive development in each character's behaviours and roles was just spectacular.Unfortunately this one lacks all the above, it's just a simple story telling of a boring tale. No complexity, no depth of character, no villain, no supernatural enemy, nothing to keep the audience waiting for the next episode.I play game on my phone when i watch it, because it's not engaging enough to keep me entertained.It's almost the end of first season and nothing special has happened yet. Maybe the original text which the series is based on doesn't really have anything special to offer, I haven't read it so I can't judge, but what i have watched, isn't worthy enough to carry the title."
"If this show was on the CW it would be the most watched show on the channel, ever. But this is a HBO show and these plot lines have no place in it or anywhere near GoT property. There is no balance of characters. The show is lacking in everything that made GoT great, except dragons that are normally just there and don't do too much, woop-dee-doo. I get where the show is going but I am not intrigued by how it's getting there, none of the characters are likable and I really couldn't care less on who wins in the end. The send this lazy plot back to the cw and trying again in a few years. Expand the universe, add to the mythology, create interesting characters that we'll want to invest in. Leave this trash where it should have always been. In the trash."
"Almost always sequels, prequels, and reboots disappoint. The first episode had everything intriguing and larger than life. To say I'm excited to see where this goes and how the story is told is a understatement."
"Hte actors' performance was great. The story is being well developed. It leaves you wanting for more, in the good way. I loved GOT, and having read Fire & Blood, I really enjoyed the start of HOTD. I can't wait till next week."
"I've been following the making of this show since pre production and i cant believe it is finally here. The book it is based on is brilliant and has an actual ending so i had very high hopes and it didnt disappoint. Little bit surprised we are starting with Rhaenyra still so young but from following filming i know exactly where this season is going.Not gonna lie though, i cant wait for the time jump in episode 6, i wanna see Aemond One Eye, Baela, Aegon II, Helaena & VHAGAR! Bring it onnn."
"I like that 5 episodes are dedicated to young versions of Rhaenyra and Alicent. It's always better to do something like this then do small flash backs between series which mostly doesn't fill the story as it has to and I always have the feeling that writers are doing flahsbacks, because they forgot to say something before and then they need this small time travel to fill the story so it makes more sense. Love that they took time to explain even small details, because I think it will help us to understand better why every character is the way he/she is and why they are making the decisions they're making.I don't understand the comments, that main characters were miscast. I think they are doing marvelous job and chemistry between them are undeniable. I don't know how ""old"" Rhaenyra and Alicent will be portrayet in future but till Episode 5 this actors are doing amazing job!It has been a long time since I was so into the series!It's very very promising and I hope they won't ruin this great series how they ruined the last 2 seasons of GOT."
"House of Dragon contains the essential of George R R Martin, with the outstanding touch of Miguel Sapochnik like Director and now showrunner. The soundtrack is beautiful with reminiscent of GOT that works perfectly. If you had any doubt about this new project, I can tell you, just enjoy your trip to Westeros !"
"Dont know why people says its a bad show.. if i compare first episode of house of the dragon with first episode of got this new one is x10 better than old got.. i remember first 6 episodes of got to be very boring , even i stop watching it , and came back to watch cuz a friend told me its going to be better and it was, for me house of the dragon is best show of this year , i really don know why people says its boring.. and gave 1 star.. tell.me what to watch if you guys are so expert and this show deserve 1 star.. tell me better show from this year..."
"Kind of basic and boring first episode. They're looking for an heir and they land on the obvious choice. If the rest of the series is court drama I'll be disappointed.There were some fight scenes at night, but I have no idea what it was about nor what happened. Scenes were too dark to see anything."
"It's not a stretch to say that this episode is more compelling than the GOT pilot episode. House of the Dragon starts with a good balance of necessary dialogue and dramatic moments. The character roles are performed well and it is great to dive further into the familial conflict of House Targaryen. The ending of the first episode adds a lot of potential for different storylines , hopefully adding to the variety of of interesting character arcs .Hopefully."
"GOT 1.0 was great for creating and telling a multi-cultural tale with elements rarely on the screen. You could change the dialog to say mandarin and it still would be relatable and entertaining to 800 million people. With story lines you rarely see. The very first episode of 1.0 involved incest. Who does that? 2.0 looks like GOT but never quite reaches the same production value. It's definitely a plastic imitation and something created by committee. Definitely an english slanted production with dialog and story someone could write, and probably did, while intoxicated. A mashup of about 99 out of 100 BBC productions but covered up with leftover props from 1.0."
"I had low expectations for this show after S8 of GOT, I was surprised after episode 1 and 2, I though that possibly the writers had somehow re-created the magic of GOT. I was wrong. My first issue is storylines, in the first episode of GOT we find out about the situation in westeros aswell as across the narrow sea, all while introducing you to the huge ensemble cast who are playing themselves to the extreme so you can really get an idea of their motivations. In HoTD I'm 4 episodes in, the only storyline is who will be heir after this king dies, which no doubt will happen in the last episode of this series I imagine. Daemon is a great character but again the writers have not done him any justice, he's effectively all bark and no bite at this point. As demonstrated when he kills the Crabfeeder, (a terrifying character who's presence on screen makes you feel uneasy, who was killed before he could even speak of his motivations) he cut through the crabfeeders men like butter which does not mean much as they seem to be pirates. The show expects us to be impressed with Daemons fighting ability without showing us a worthy opponent other then that the knight in episode 1, who beat him with ease.The main plot is the only thing carrying the show, with very thick plot armour, which still makes for a entertaining watch, dare I say it better then most things on TV these days.My main Gripe is the lack of great supporting characters so far, or properly fleshed out ones at least. Could any of you name the members of the kings council without google? Maybe, but that maesters name would be right at the back of your head, useless character. Game of Thrones was able to be brilliantly paced because of the performances and writing of the supporting characters, all with their own motives and morals.I hate to be that guy but what's with all the conversations about misogynism, I find it strange, if we're saying misogynism is finally being tackled today in the 21st century, then we are all aware of how different things would've been for women in the middle ages let's say. I realise the universe is fictional but I think anyone with a brain can see at least the upper class men in the shows have it slightly easier then their female counter-parts. Show don't tell storytelling could've solved this issue, as TV is visual medium, and the audience is not dumb.The one thing I can say is Ramin Djwadi knocked it out the park with his score again, that man's talent knows no limits, check out the westworld score if you haven't already.Lots of bad spellings and use of punctuation apologies."
"An absolute visual spectacle, The CGI of dragons was incredible seeing dragons we have only ever heard the names of brought to life in this manner is astounding. This is an absolutely faithful adaptation of the book Fire & Blood. The changes that have been made (ages, adding a layer of complexity on to an already heart wrenching scene) only serve to increase our emotional connection to the story and do not in any way take away from the original spirit of the story. In regard to the skin color change with the Velaryons, I don't think it has much effect on the story and Steven Toussaint is amazing at capturing the persona of the Sea Snake."
"I liked GOT with the exception of the ending. So it wasn't a surprise I would like House of the Dragon. Its defiantly off to a good start. It has the same feel as the early episodes of GOT. The cinematics look good and the charters are interesting. The music is annoyingly similar to GOT. Some might like it but something more original would have been nice, but I am just being nitpicky. The story is interesting if somewhat predictable. Not surprising since it just started. I expect it will get less so as the story progresses. There is plenty of action and brutal violence. Hopefully they can keep it up. There are few new Tv shows out that aren't shoving some message down your throat when all you want to do is disconnect for a bit. Good job."
"I have scrolled through a few pages of reviews and the negativity is a little surprising. I think nearly all of us can agree that GoT ended badly but HotD started really well for me. I wad intrigued from the get-go and was kept interested throughout the episode. It looked great, the outfits and armour was incredible and the acting was top-notch.Those who marking this as a 1 out of 10 and such are clearly not in tune with the different aspects of what makes up a tv show - being completely objective there is no way this should get anything below a 6 even if you didn't enjoy some aspects of it.Anyway, I hope this helps anyone reading it as the first episode felt like I slipped back in to peak GoT."
I loved the pilot episode. The dragons look better than in game of thrones. I think the characters did a good job and hoping it continues with this pace. HBO really put a lot into this. Great start.
"Dear freaking god this is soooo boring. Just hours of folks droning on and on about things only a few care about. Reminds of Game of Thrones, which was the same BUT took the time to drop in some bloodshed and loud scenes to wake you up every 15 minutes. This is embarrassingly terrible. How they thought it was a good idea to do a prequel to one of the worst shows ever produced is surprising. Do yourself a favour and read the books. This is not worth your time and effort. UNLESS you are looking for something to fall asleep to. ""There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived... He's our memory. The keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines, our triumphs, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?"" There 600 words."
"I went into this show with very low expectations. Wow was I wrong. I much prefer the characters to GOT and am eagerly awaiting the next season!! The visuals are stunning and the actors are seriously talented. I even prefer the into sequence of HOTD over the one for GOT. I thought Daenerys was the best Targaryen but man, has Rhaenyra blown her out of the water. Her and Daemon are bar none my favorite Targaryens. I also enjoyed watching Paddy play Viserys and think he did a bang up job. There is literally not one negative thing I can say about this show. 2024 needs to here already! The wait is torture!"
"In case of the House of the Dragon I should say that they done a great job. A thing that made me wonder was that, the story doesn't revel the personalitys of the character's soon. It wasn't like the game of thrones. That show was doomed to revel the personalitys of the character's.Another great thing about HOD (House of Dragon) is the special effects. For an imaginary story the image of the un_ real thing is a key necessity, and the HOD dose this great.Let's be fair, we can't compare this series to game of thrones. That show was a miracle in tv history. A few things can compare and even fewer things can be better.It should be noted that, according to that last lines, the house of dragen was good in his level and I will recommend this series to everyone who loves game of thrones.At the end I just wanna thank the J. R. R. Martin because of the fantastic story's that he had wrote and (I hope) write."
"Nearly two hundred years before Game of Thrones the King Viserys of the House of Targaryen is the undisputed ruler of Westeros and surrounding lands. However, when he names his daughter Rhaenyra as his successor he sets in motion a series of events that many years in the future will lead to a bitter feud over who should sit on the Iron Throne.I largely enjoyed Game of Thrones but thought it was overrated. While some of the storylines were interesting, the overall plot lacked focus at times due to the producers wanting to draw out the series for as long as possible to maximise revenue. The show should have been about two seasons shorter. Then when it did wrap up we had the disaster that was Season 8.It was thus with some scepticism that I watched House of the Dragon. To my surprise it was initially very interesting and engaging. The characters were supportable and even the (apparent) villain had some redeeming qualities, making me think it would be as much character-driven as plot-driven.Initially House of the Dragon was brilliant and better than Game of Thrones. Unlike GoT, House of the Dragon didn't have the irritation of having to follow heaps of characters, many of whom I didn't care about, and their independent sub-plots: it was just a small group of characters involved in one storyline. There weren't many great action scenes - a minor negative - but there was this great sense that something big and eventful would happen at any moment. This tension made for a wonderful atmosphere.Sadly, this spell of un-GoT-like brilliance only lasted for five episodes. Everything changes in Episode 6: the timeline gets propelled forward ten years, heaps of new characters are added, some characters are played by different actors. Previously likeable characters are suddenly dislikeable to the point that there's only maybe one or two characters worth supporting and maybe not even them.Moreover, the tone becomes like GoT: plot is more important than character engagement and the storyline becomes more Machiavellian.Some of the plot developments in the next few episodes were interesting but there were also those that made no sense, thrown in for drama sake and nothing else (the ending to Episode 9 takes the cake here).I tried to remain attentive and regain some of the engagement of the earlier episodes but it was an impossible task, such was the dearth of anything or anybody to keep my attention. Watching became a chore more than anything else and reminded me of the long passages of play in GoT, especially in Seasons 3 and 4, where I was just watching to keep up to date rather than for enjoyment.Overall, it's entertaining enough but there's heaps of other TV shows I'd rather be watching. I won't be back for Season 2."
"Might just be the familiarity of they worlds now, but this was a much better opening episode. The acting was far stronger, the budget hasn't gone backwards so it looks fabulous and the story gave you enough in the first hour to know a lot of bloodshed, backstabbing, chaos and dragon action is coming our way. Was the best thing I'd seen Matt Smith do for a while, wiping the stain of Morbius away with a wry sneer. Can't wait for next week, more than pleased."
"Super high production value and very similar to the original Game of Thrones in storytelling. If you love Game of Thrones, you will love House of the Dragon.I am not the biggest fantasy fan...but my husband is, so I have been along for the ride from the beginning. This story pre-dates Game of Thrones and is the story of the war between the greens and the blacks for the Targaryen's claim on the iron throne. The story is filled with the grotesque lust for power, murder, sex...and some very graphic birthing scenes.The costumes as usual are spectacular as are some of the sets. A couple of my complaints: first a lot of the action scenes are too dark to see what is actually happening and second I can not stand most of the horrible white wigs worn by a significant number of the Targaryens...especially the boys' stringy white hair.The show is pretty graphic and very violent, just be forewarned. A recommendation for all Game of Throne and George R. R. Martin fans (series is based on his books), also for fans of fantasy...I think you will love it.For those like me, who it isn't your cup of tea...you can appreciate the quality of both the production and the costumes."
"It's bad I meen like really bad, like a lame soap opera you desperately wanna love but just can't. Iv watched GoT full show about 6 times the last 10 years. And iv loved every second of it. I feel asleep to HoD. I did switch to GoT episode s3e10 and realized that 5 minutes is more interesting than 5 episodes of HoD.All of those epic stories whit great background to all characters and events overlapping! Shocking us that won't even fit to an episode have been replaced whit poor script and fillers whit lame conversations.I don't believe that G.r.r wrote this garbage, I just don't! And I don't believe that the cost per episode."
"It is amazingly wonderful and very powerful. One of the most beautiful openings in the history of the series, surpassing Game of Thrones, the characters are wonderful, the dialogues are very strong, the scenes of the dragons are strong and amazing, the graphics are also wonderful, and the dialogues are wonderful , and the only one is very strong and beautiful."
The thing is that it gave the same vibes as its predecessor. Excellent directed and background score was also extraordinary. VFX of Dragon was a bit lagging behind as we can clearly differentiate it to be unnatural. Anyway we can take that into consideration as it's just a TV show.
Very promising indeed! Especially loved Matt Smit he is sublime as ever!Very beautiful costumes and well played by all actors. Love the dragons...I can't wait until the 28th of August:-)
"A lot of people don't understand. Game of Thrones is a masterpiece, in order to come out with something similar is not easy. House of dragon is so promising and good that if you're a true Game of Thrones fan you'll honestly love it more than the Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones started off very well but Towards the end it was rushed. Here, they have kept the pace very balanced so it won't seem too rushed or too slow. This one is all about the dragons.House of dragons is about all what we were hoping for when we were watching Game of Thrones. There are so many dragons in this one and such fascinating politics and your regular Game of Thrones vibe but it's gonna leave you wanting for a lot more. Trust me, by the time House of dragons end, You would wish to see more of it."
"Perhaps some will wonder about the secret of this evaluation and the answer is because I feel that I am watching an epic of the throne of power. This throne and what friends and even relatives do makes you feel that it is a curse. Perhaps the only thing that bothers me a little is Time passed, but I began to get used to them explaining the things that happened, but I wish to clarify them more. Other than that, the series in general makes me feel the beauty and splendor of George R. R. Martin's world because it contains shocks and unexpected things. It's wonderful and I love it and enjoy it a lot."
"This is the only series and GOT which i dont skip ahead because of boredom, i never get bored of it and always grabs my attention and keeps being interesting all the way through the series. I am very exited to see the other episodes of the season for sure, I also have a feeling its about to get better and more exciting. I recommend it for everyone to least have a taste from it and check it out for your selves but on the other hand i dont think its on game of thrones level yet but again it could get better further on with a huge potential since its from the original game of thrones writer. I also cant wait for new characters to get introduced so it can get more interesting.After watching the first season yeah it definitely got more interesting and entertaining which I expected, I already love the characters but if you watch it don't get used to the characters because they change every few episodes or so if you start loving a character like i did am sorry but they might change later on the season. But if you loved GOT it's definitely worth a watch especially if you bored or got time in ur hands like I did. (I can't wait for season 2)"
"After long hesitation, I decide to give this a dry. The show is alright. All the familiar trophes and characterizations from GoT are there: b*****d children, s*x and violence. There are just some things that bother me, which lower the score.First of all, Milly Alcock, if I remember her name correctly, just doesn't work. Not only does she look very apart from the adult Rhaenyna, over all she has the constant look of snobbiness on her face. Emma D'arcy seems like a different characters. Olivia Cook as Alicent has the annoying trademark of hers, the sad face, constantly on. Matt Smith has the standard ""I'm a mean guy"" - look on all the time. He should prehaps go back to acting school to get some variety.Second of all, since there are less families compared to GoT, the variation of the characters is non existent. Pretty much all Targaryens and Velaryons share the same wig and people have such similar names that it's some times confusing to remember which is which.Third of all, similar plot points with GoT make it feel like HotD tries the same gimmicks with less success.Maybe Targaryens just aren't my cup of tea. White hair people marrying their close relatives get pretty dull pretty fast."
"The series was going in the right direction, only for them to completely mess it up by recasting Rheanarys. It's a travesty! They could've easily made her look a bit older. What makes it even more ridiculous is that the cast that stayed on looks exactly the same, other than the king whom seems to age 40 years each episode. What a shame! Other than that, it starts slow but midway through the seasons starts picking up. I don't understand a lot of fans complaining about the show being slow and boring, while GOT started off wayyyyy slower and 65% of the series was boring as hell. Not to mention they ruined a couple of entire seasons, including the last one!The visuals on HOD are great and i am looking forward to see what comes next. I did almost stop watching after the recast though and it still annoys me."

"StoryI disagree with the bad reviews about acting. I think the actors are fine given the script they've been dealt with. I'm sure the actors could do a great job with a great script. Characterization comes down to the story at the core.Ultimately, what I want to watch is an entertaining (and sometimes poignant) story. I'm up to episode 4 of HotD and after watching this installment I realized I've just been watching a soap opera with a bit of shock value. The first 3 episodes I was mildly enjoying, and I went into episode 4 expecting it the eventual opening of the main story, after this 3 episode build up. But episode 4 just said to me, ""nope, there is not much story here, it's just a bit of family drama in a castle."" There is so little intrigue, mystery, fantasy, build up, tension, and the whole cast is so limited that I feel stuck in this castle and I want to get out. At least in the previous 3 episodes there was a bit of escape on the dragons and the battle with the crab dudes from the triarchy.I just rewatched the first 16 mins of Game of Thrones episode 1 out of curiosity to compare openings with HotD. Wow. What a difference. Go watch it and you'll see how to start an epic fantasy. HotD does not give the same sense that we're going on an adventure or that we're going to stand against a greater evil or that we're going to solve a mystery or that we're going to meet a host of exciting characters... But... I'll keep watching because I have faith in George Martin's storytelling. If the writers are following his story, perhaps it'll pick up soon."
"I used to think it was the George R. R. Martin script that made the first 5 seasons of GoT truly exceptional and outstanding, as the last seasons were very disappointing. But after watching House of Dragon I have realised that it was not only the script, but also the amazing casting, authentic locations, and production in general: Because in House of Dragon, the Georg R. R. Martin script is there, but nothing else. Sleep inducing casting, and almost sickening use of Computerized Graphical Imagery. In short I feel this show is most resembling a screen saver. It is even a level lower than the last seasons of G.o.T."
"First episode showed promise and looks to tell a great story.Really hoping the writing stays clear and answers questions throughout.Disregarding the birthing scene, the first ep set a great base for what's expected ahead in this series!"
"As House of the Dragon is a series after game of thrones as prequel,fans were not believing that HOD will be beyond GOT. But Its fantastic and has lots of Easter Eggs from game of thrones and their world-building shows how the seven Kindoms were Glorious and Powerful like a better version of places in game of thrones. Conflicts between Targaryens themselves and with other strong houses are really interesting and each character is unique in their way. Rhaenyra Targaryens and Damon Targaryens are the best Character so far in Episode1 to 3. There is also a breath-taking Cinamatography since from the very start of the show and when match with dragons...Scences from the Targaryens show are much more better and attractive than most of the other Fantasy shows even more than game of thrones. GOT is amazing but a little bit dark in Lightning and not very clear but HOD fixed it and upgraded it and gives more beautiful episodes. Plots are as strong as Game of thrones like showing the problems and Plans of them in the same time with Character development and introducing new characters either. This show is amazing with their own style but giving flashbacks and memories from game of thrones and linking them and Explaining some untold secrets of game of thrones.Dragons are the best part of the show and the main reason why House of the dragon is Epic and masterpiece. There are colourful dragons and they are too nice to complain anything."
"I don't wanna praise the show too early, but the first episodes are great. The performances are incredible, sets look great and the effects are cool. I really enjoy Matt Smith in a more villainous role and Paddy Considine is always pleasant. I really hope it stays good for the majority of the series. As someone who is a huge fan of Game of Thrones (pre-S8) I hope that they do not mess this one up. I have big hopes but can't be too hyped. Please don't pull a D&D and just give up on quality and good storytelling for some cheap shock value or soap opera drama. I hope my gut feling is correct and that this stays fantastic!"
Gotta go see it. Can't wait until next Sunday.We have something to look forward to again on Sundays and that's a good thing.Completely fun but there is history nuggets being dropped that tie all the shoes together.
Im getting strong Got vibes as well as the original books vibe.because I already knw wht happens but it still manages to keep me hyped up for this new series no wonder hbo made another exceptional series.
My original review was that I like it and not loving it. I'm changing my attitude towards it after getting to the halfway point. It's absolutely pure heaven to me the tension is insane. One can only wonder how this will end. The stories that have been played out has been nicely woven with so much manipulation it's still not clear. 4 more to go and I cannot wait for it.It's shows like this that keep me hooked. I love the cleverness of the story telling and I love it when I get to use my brain.
"It's good only because is connected to Game of Thrones. But, the cast is poorly chosen... and it's famous just because it has to be famous. The whole Velaryons just don't make any sense.Has a lot of illogical brutality and I personally expected more from the effects, at moments they are too fake.If it wasn't for Game of Thrones (another commercial series) this one just would be another good mid-day series to watch.It's interesting, yes, but doesn't deserve so much noise, mostly because there are so many good and much better movies/ series to watch and discover.You get just the an okay thing.Nothing more, nothing less."
"No magic so far (Episodes 1-3), dragons aren't as huge as I expected considering the lore of the past explained in GOT. It's more like Rome or The Tudors than GOT. No comedy relief, no big personalities or colourful backstories with Tyrion, LittleFinger or Varys. I hope they'll be bringing in some supernatural elements and building a hero's journey from it. It's been a bit patchworky so far, but it's been watchable, and I do think they cast a solid core princess in Milly Alcock. If only she had something massive to do instead of sulking in the palace. Considering GOT opened with a beheading, a pack of magical wolves, zombie attacks, and a threat of the end of existence, we need more. But I'm watching it happy to have any form of this world back on my screen."
"What a shame. The script is really poor. Too violent (it's just not believable and clearly written to shock) the sex is unnecessary and underscores the clunky 'oppressed women' theme, and the dialogue is dire. I'm surprised they don't use patriarchy in some places. It's basically a cat fight between two queens. Always good to make the women the centre of the show eh? The men are largely supporting actors playing unlikable idiots, although some do it better than others. None of the actors have a royal air (remember Charles Dance in GoT?) they just play characters. The casting really let's this show down. Having said that Matt Smith is awesome, and Rhys Ilfans is pretty good too. The sets, costumes and locations are great, but that's not enough. What a shame."
"Weak characters, doing pointless actions for no reason. A love story and an intrigue in which nobody believes, at a kindergarten level. Even more disappointing than the end of Game of Thrones. The dragons are only in the name of the series. In five episodes we don't see them for more than 5 minutes altogether. Until now no spectacular scene and the sets are less impressive than in Game of Thrones. I don't understand the meaning of doing this series if it's just a pale, less interesting copy of Game of Thrones with less budget and no good script. I'll probably stop watching it...It's a pity. The Game of Thrones universe had so much potential. It's a shame to see what they've done with it."
"It does brings the nostalgia. The same thrill ,the same excitement,the same production and very very well directed.It was so so so much worth waiting for."
"I listened to the audiobook and it was incredible... I was doubtful before the show came out because the book does not resemble the ASOIAF series (its more of a history book than a story that we experience through 1st person). Nonetheless, they did an incredible job adapting the book and reminded me of the good seasons of GOT. They are setting up interesting political dilemmas and the acting is overall very good. We will see how the plot evolves throughout the season to reveal all of the easter eggs and foreshadowing which would make the experience even better (this is an element that I fairly enjoyed in GOT). Overall, the show is exceeding my expectations up until now. Hopefully they keep it up!"
"I began episode 1 with skepticism, and I ended with high expectations!!! Brilliant execution of the first episode, along with a compelling story that has laid the corner stones for a great series. And yes, as exciting as GOT but hoping it will take the bar higher!"
"This is my favourite episode so far. I felt so many emotions, mostly positive ones. The cast and performances were excelent as always. Main characters are starting to show their true colors or at least showing us layers we haven't seen before. The narrative and the direction was brilliant. It's never done before in game of thrones, I'm so glad they're taking the right choices because Fire and Blood wasn't an easy book to adapt on a TV series. There are so many time jumps on the story and they managed it smoothly. I know a big time jump is coming on the next episode so I'm so curious on how they are going todo it."
"Lots of people seem to be very upset by the switch in a actors in episode 6 but I love it. The series has so far been very slow and not that interesting. Following the story of one character with a very basic plot and not many other interesting characters. I actually stopped watching after episode 4 because I just didn't get hooked on it at all, while GOT was like a drug I couldn't stop. We'll my friends told me to keep watching and that they would switch actors in episode 6 so I kept going. Episode 5 was actually really good. BUT EPISODE 6! Wow I thought it was a amazing! The new actors has soo much character to them! It is now funny, there are more interesting characters, the plot is unpredictable, the characters are much more well formed and much more bloody and dark. I was hooked the whole episode and it felt like a whole new series.I want to recommend everyone that thought the series was really boring to keep going. I would rate episode 6 10/10 and I think it's much closer to GOT than all episodes before!! Very excited for next Monday :)"
"This show has had me hooked from the first scene. In true Game of Thrones style the character building, story and sub plots are a master class in making you caring for individual characters. The pace is perfect and acting is top notch. As always Matt Smith is a revelation. I'm not a fan of how the original GOT ended, but I have high hopes on this show. Please carry on with this quality of writing and if Disney and Amazon are reading these reviews. Buck your ideas or lose your customers. If you continue to turn out trash. We will simply turn you off and subscribe to something with better content. Peace."
"I disliked the actors swap, especially for Rhaenyra. To use Emma D'Arcy was a grave mistake. I mean she isn't a bad actor. But we all were already attached to Milly, they should just aged her, make up, like they did with so many other characters. IT SUCKED, to see Emma, I tried giving her a chance, but we jumped from a Rhaenyra with charm and was strong. To her being totally weathered child birth machine, which she by the way, said she never could se herself as. Then to just giving herself up to daemon. Like that cool dynamic where it seemed that the young Rhaenyra had the power and could influence Daemon. The older Rhaenyra was just a door mat.I hope for the next season they can just swap back. I give it 10 out of 10 then.Second thing, they didn't have to make a time jump, we enjoyed the present they could have added a few more episodes actually portraying those 10 years. I do like Rhaenyra's and the queen's kids, some of those characters are really interesting but it didn't have to rush like that. Like aemond targaryen was a super cool character, but he so did not look his age. Like when his eye got taken out the kids look the same age, but then after a few years he looked 25 and the other still small boys."
It is a fun show to watch:)
"BTW House of the Dragon is set 200 years before the Game of Thrones story.The timeline and characters have a depth that continues to build in each episode and these layers are the reason why the story is original and interesting.Personally I am looking forward to seeing how the civil war during the Targaryen rule of the Seven Kingdoms plays out on screen.Plus the House of the Dragon story will provide an extra layer of history previously mentioned in many Game of Thrones episodes.A rewatch of Game of Thrones will be in my future once the House of the Dragon story has been completed.The diversity of the cast makes sense and is more believable when the screen reflects reality.I like the progressive thinking and views of sexuality that the show puts forward.I'm a huge fan of the radical ideas surrounding female characters found within House of the Dragon story.The women are given the ability to take ownership of their sexuality and seek their ""passions"", even though they are not entirely in possession of their bodies. The women have choices and aren't forcibly raped which is a step in the right direction.It is a different story and a different timeline of events that our house is enjoying immensely. Love!"
"I've watched the first 4 episodes and YES, it's too early to say anything conclusive yet. Still, I find myself in a feeling that anything I've seen so far haven't interested me a one bit.Technically the show is great. Probably better than GoT in some ways. Actors/actresses are mostly great and the characters are interesting (excluding the protsgonist so far).And that's the problem, it seems there is only one protagonist to follow and not a particularly interesting one. At least not for me. I don't mind slow burn but there haven't been any single logical or interesting turn of events that would keep my interest in this.I've seen the other reviews and most are very positive. I even discussed with my friend about this, 'cause he seems to be interested of the story. I just don't find anything really compelling.Original GoT was a slow burn but it made you care about the characters and their individual story arcs from the very start. This haven't been able. At least not yet.I wasn't particularly interested of this beforehand so there were no massive hype behind it. But I gotta admit, I wasn't hyped about GoT, Witcher or even Arcane but those I enjoyed a lot.So, it's not that there was massive expectations coming in to this. It was not the quality of acting or the technical side. It's just that there's not really anything interesting going on or anything particular to look forward to.I'm hoping it gets better towards the end. In many ways it's a solid show, still the most important is lacking In quality. It can get better for sure. This is just a review of the first 4 episodes. I will update this if there is a need."
"The story is very slow and was just getting going then came episode six. Suddenly they jump ahead 10 years with different actors and the new ones are terrible. I don't know what they were thinking.All the old plot lines are gone. On top of that writers thought it was a good idea to make the script completely confusing. Feels like you wasted your time on the first 5 episodes as they didn't serve any purpose to the story.Anyways, I don't know what else to say. It was starting to grow on me then they ruined it. The new actors are terrible compared to the original actresses.I'm done with this series."
"I would like to begin by saying I'm no critic but an enthusiast... I felt a need to add a comment to this series as I haven't had the pleasure to do that in time for the main one, Game of Thrones. So I humbly say this to you dear producers: A masterpiece! I call it a real prequel. It is on point! Thanks to the cast, the directing, the plot, the costumes etc etc. And of course by episode 6.. we see the time gap, we feel it.. But the actors, and especially their exceptional work made me forget about it and almost tear up. I say well-done and thank you for not letting go of the Game of Thrones saga!"
"This series has it all. The story just isn't rushed, neither was GoT, actually had a similar start, just go check.. I swear these haters are simple people who expect it to kick off into the highest gear from the start, it's so laughable how narrowminded it is.The cast is AMAZING, and their acting is AMAZING, too bad for anyone who can't see it, just means you don't know what good acting is, sadly.Amd try to understand that this isn't the same as GoT, it's a different part of the story, so maybe it won't be as exciting and fantastic as the part we have seen in GoT, but it certainly isn't bad. They are building the story in a perfect pace for anyone who isn't blinded by their insane expectations or lack of patience.It's gonna be great! No doubt about it, but probably won't reach the level of GoT, but it's already much better than season 8 of GoT, that's for sure! I saw some people mention that only people who liked season 8, would like this show, so thought I'd set the record straight, I didn't care much for season 8, it was too rushed! Which is exactly what they aren't doing here, noobs. So to all the haters, go look at the total score of 8.7 and go cry yourself to sleep. 10/10."
"I didn't expect anything about this TV show, are bringing it to us. I'm GoT lover and I will watch also is it was a bad production, but I'm happy to recommend this series for everyone GoT lovers and not.Furthermore, I was a lector of the book that is based in the main line history and can't imagine the perfect combinations between script and cast. The production choose an incredible cast (also all the teams that make this cast shine more than sun).About the script, the big time jumps that makes the TV show is it not easy to did as they do. I'm so happy about all the series and every Monday on my country will wait the post of new chapter of House of Dragon.<3."
"It may just be the EP 1 but it has already the potential to be one of the best shows ever made. The next big thing from HBO .It has everything GoT stood for until (you know). The costume and casting choices are top notch.Hearing ""Dracarys"" will make you feel like the good times are back again and the ending credits will sent anybody a chill down their spines. Crazy only after mere 3 years I got nostalgic vibes hearing the music again. I wasn't planning to read the original novella but couldn't wait to see how the story unfolds so here I am waiting for EP 2 albeit carrying the knowledge to be candidate for Master of Citadel."
"Great show always and forever Dragons . I hope there will be more war and action scenes and young princess i will miss if you had more scenes it would be awesome . Good quality and started well, I hope it will end like this . Fire must be more time lapse too long seems like it was too much. I hope we see all the dragons and what I am most curious about is where do these dragons come from first, I wish there was a detailed show. At least 3 or 4 chapters should be introduced separately for each dynasty. Let everything come out in the time of justice and judgment let's see dragon power now it's show time."
I think this is instead of the last two seasons of GOT and we'll be watching and enjoying great artwork as much as we enjoyed GOT except for the disasters of the last two seasons
"and I think one of the most important strengths of the series is that we are attached to characters we love to watch like Damon and Rinera as it was in GOT. We licked a lot with Jon Snow, Daenerys, Tyrion, Jimmy and the rest of these great characters that we always loved and we spent a lot of fun time together. I know it's stupid to judge the show by its first two episodes, but I know George R. R. Martin will wow us as he did before."
"This is most noticeable in the start of the second episode where we get a big spoiler for what's gonna happen in what I imagine is a later season in the future, this more or less makes the story from where we are currently until that event plays out. It's now noticeable in the 3rd episode, we get violently thrown in 2 years in the future with no context, although the writing and acting is good relationships has changed and new characters have been introduced to the show with no build up or explanation. The Crab king seems tho have somewhat of a bigger part then we got to see as well as the deteriorating relationship ship between daemon and the corlys house,It's things like this that can make or brake a show. The first few seasons of the original GOT got down perfectly and that's why they are considered some of the best tv ever made.Although it's a lot of new people in the production as well as a completely new cast to a big of a show like this, so I trust that thing will be learned and future episodes and seasons will only get better."
"Right from the start, this show pulls you in and invest in the show. Unlike that other fantasy show that's running at the moment, it introduces the characters and the plot points without boring you to death. It's exciting, it keeps you wanting more, there's a complicated plot going on but you understand all of it. This show certainly doesn't insult it's viewers.It's wonderfully diverse in a good way. It's non insulting or tokenistic. Every character makes sense and deserves their place.And holy cow. Matt Smith is amazing in this. He's an excellent villain with a sympathetic twist in the best GOT tradition.Definitely check this out."
"Unlike GoT the characters aren't developed enough for the audience to be invested in them, there are few memorable moments or dialogue/lines (name me 1 good quote).The pacing is terrible, there are episodes where hardly anything happens, too much is compressed into too short a time frame to give it much meaning but at the same time the story seems drawn out, it's not very good story telling. You can tell it was developed by committee.The casting is terrible - the entire conflict and story arc revolves around succession to the Iron Throne and talk of ""pure blood"" - if this is the primary concern of every charter and presumably the people they rule, why do people look so different with the exception of white/blonde hair? It doesn't fit in the world we are being brought into."
"I've suffered through 7 episodes... well, giving up in the middle of the 7th.This is a soap opera that housewives and househusbands who were into General Hospital but would like to see a couple dragons ""might"" like.Of course, I don't know why anyone would watch this.Skimming through the review, looks like everybody more or less agrees... still don't get the 5s and 6s for what they categorize as ""disappointing"".There is nothing here for fans of GoT but a few teasers that really aren't teasers.The last terrible episode of GoT foretold a round of terrible spinoffs. Looks like they did this to make sure you just how bad it is going to be.I kept trying. Don't waste your time."
"Just finished watching... omg, it was thrilling, exciting and above all a joy to watch. The acting was second to none. Throughly enjoyed every episode! At first I was sceptical and thought it would be woke, to my amazement it was not. This is what happens when you leave out woke and concentrate on making worth while entertaining series, Disney could learn a lot from this. All the actors were amazing, it felt like I was there! That's how I know it was good when you feel part of it and not just watching for the sake of it and hoping it gets better... thank god the writers and they knew what their audience wanted and that was...house of the dragons."
"I realized what I am missing - Game of Thrones had multiple storylines, developing simultaneously, with very different strong characters. Maybe this is just the fault of a slow start, but focussing on just one family and one story lacks in comparison, and feels a bit long and boring, like we are there 24/7, watching them cooking breakfast and going to the restroom. Does not have anything really catchy so far, but otherwise, nice story, and beautifully done production. Hopefully it picks up soon... Two of the characters have potential, but has a feeling of a soap opera so far, like I can skip 10 episodes and still know where it is going."
"HOTD pilot has all the elements that made huge and unforgettable those first 6 seasons of GOT, but with much better budget, and much more experimented masters minds behind the cameras like Miguel Sapochnik, Thanks HBO for this second opportunity, coming back to Westeros during the splendor of the TargaryenÂ´s legacym never felt so good, specially after that non sense of season GOT season finale."
"I found the 1st episode full of action and it kept you watching waiting to see how things went with declaring a new king/queen. Definitely going to follow this serious and hopefully it'll not disappoint as it goes on, definitely check it out though if your into myths etc."
"4 episodes in and I'm finding that each episode is better than the last and the first episode was great!It's easier to follow than GOT and you could easily enjoy it without seeing anything from that 8 season behemoth. You just need to understand that nothing is off limits.This show really demonstrates what is capable when a big budget is spent in the right areas and you have a cast of actors who are playing their characters with finesse.If you're looking for a new show or missed the GOT train, there's no better time to get started. Weekly episodes are great, especially when they have the HBO mic drop at the end of every episode."
"It's spectacular , amazing and phenomenal cant praise it enough George rr Martin is the best writer of our time .In the end its better than better call saul and Breaking bad"
Bs t5sy ahsn mn Got
Got is the Goat.
"They absolutely nailed the dragon scenes and I got goosebumbs when I saw Rhaenyra riding her dragon in the beginning.But the dialogues are just very weak. I could come up with those lines at 2 am in the morning.It kind of feels like a cheat code, where you skip all the small, very needed dialogues, inbetween and skip to the epic scenes with cool music over and over. But that's not how a good story is told.I really like the actors of Otto, Rhaenyra and Daemon and the rest of cast ist great too.But don't expect Storytelling Level of GoT Season 1- 4, it's a mix between Season 5 + 7 in my opinion."
"Really! Bad reviews?? , what was not to like with the return of this epic. Brilliant beginnings that has already sucked you into the story line, bring on the Game of Thrones amongst the houses."
"After watching the pilot, i now understand why HBO was worried and shelved this title for a while. So far few actors shine, most are unknown, and acting wasnt bad, but not great either. We will see what the show brings over the next few weeks, but hopefully, after the jump in time and new actor to play certains older character, maybe things will get better.But so far, im only interested in maybe 2-3 char overall while the original had many (10+) interesting char.There are a few easter eggs in there to the original show, but this need to have a life of it own; something it has not demonstrated so far.Really hope that following a under achieved pilot that thing got reviewed and changed for there remaining regular episode of this 1st season, cause if it continue in the same direction, i do not see a second season in our future.Personnally, i am not expecting a second GoT, but im expecting an interesting prequel that will explain the rise and fall of the Targearyon dynasty that lasted for many centuries. Many lines were put in GoT regarding this time, hope they can live up to it original material while we wait for Georges RR Martin to complete it litterary version which is long overdue."
"Waiting all week for one episode is such a let down in the days of Netflix. Then to wait all 7days for such a boring episode. All the episodes besides the first have been such a snooze fest.And if we wanted to see porn... we'll we'd rather just watch regular porn, rather than 5min of soft core filling up a show we've been waiting 7days for.It's the age of internet and porn, you are wasting out time with trying to be Larry Flyntt, just quit it. And no you don't need to rachet it up a notch by making it insest. NO ONE IS WATCHING THIS SHOW FOR YOUR SORRY ATTEMPT TO DIRECT PORN, we want to see a good show, serious action, deep and witty dialogue, we'll developed characters, an amazing plot.Damon has been the best part of the show same with the King, daughter/princess is doing all right.But let's get moving along already is all I can say while sitting through an entire episode. A show like this on a Sunday night should be at least pretty good, this just ain't it guys and gals.GOT was top 3 all time shows for me. This I'm about ready to walk away from. Even when GOT had a slow episode it at least had really good dialogue and interesting characters that you cared about.This crap is just weird and boring. Straight cheeks."
"Are people still annoyed about the last season of GOT? It wasn't great, we can all admit that, but boy has HOTD started strong. Great acting performances already, very brutal at times and political. Minus the comedy it has all the great elements of GOT. Excited to see what's next!"
"When the first episode began, it was very abrupt, like being thrown into the middle of a conversation that has been going on for hours....and to make things worse, it was very hard to understand what some of the actors were saying because they talked so fast with heavy accents....another aspect I honestly skipped is the brutality of the jousting...I know GOT also was brutal to watch sometimes but it's as if this prequel is trying to be even more graphic...too much so in my opinion. ...but the storyline itself became more interesting as the show progressed, so I will wait & hope I am able to understand things better on the next episode..."
"A very wonderful episode, and I hope the series will have long seasons. Thank you, HBO, for this series. A very wonderful episode, and I hope the series will have long seasons. Thank you, HBO, for this seriesA very wonderful episode, and I hope the series will have long seasons. Thank you, HBO, for this series."
"Since I read ""The Princess and the Queen"" years ago I've been chirping for a show about this story but figured it'd be the last to be made due to the budgetary problems created by dragons in GoT. After seeing episode 1! I am blown away. HotD feels more big cinema major motion picture, where GoT feels like a rather small budget episodic tv show. If you need proof on the added layer of details look no further than episode 1's Tourney of the Heir and compare it to any scene in GoT where a tourney takes place. The acting here is brilliant the emotion is heavy and the action is intense. Can't wait for the next episode 10/10."
"I was worried about this as we are moving away from comfort of the words of George R R Martin and we seen how the GOT ended.Fear not the hype is well deserved and the true game of thrones is about to start.This has been so well written and directed and already the character development is beginning and pulling us in.I am so looking forward to see where this goes.We all know if it was Disney there would he a house of the wolf and so on, however if this team can put this together the way they have over and over we will welcome some spin offs in the future.This will blow you away."
"I just saw the first episode and it seem promising, satisfying, reminding me all the images, memories of the Game of Thrones, the characters of the House of the Dragon's are connecting well to me. Story build up is going perfectly with love, rage, emotion and full of anxiety. I wish all the best to the Audience and to the each and every members of this masterpiece."
"GoT's last season underwent a great destruction that HBO should not have dared to resuscitate the comatose DRAGON. I was thinking of watching it in one go but could not wait for long as the recent releases on OTT incited pity and definitely not an honest watch. The first episode attempted to hold the lost interest of GoT fans, thanks to the historical slaughter of the entire Westeros in the last season, with an uncanny yet less satisfying resemblance. They didn't even care to work on the soundtrack, almost copied that. The first 15-20 minutes are boring straight up. The moment you try to hit the stop button on your remote, they succeed to pull you back with a term ""tournament"". But again, proved to be another disappointingly unsuccessful attempt. Towards the end, the named heir of Viserys Targaryen i.e. Rhaenyra somehow kept the last hope alive that it's not gonna be the same. Anyway, it's too early to stop watching it as the cinematography, the set even the dragons look better and brighter. Too early to rate the entire season but the first episode somehow keeps the heartbeat ticking and compels you to watch the subsequent episode."
"The thrill was top notch, you jus know that they're a lot of things that will happen down the line of the show. It gave that chill feeling of Game of thrones as it should. And you just know that there will be a lot of plot and twist as the show progresses. Great writing and the actors and actresses were top notch too."
"I'm enjoying it more as it goes on, it's still not Game of Thrones where it grabbed you in the first episode but it's improving. The characters are getting more interesting and I hope there are going to be some unexpected deaths as that's what I expect as the bar has been set.I do believe 600 characters is a bit much though as I really don't have anymore to say until I have watched more episodes, I just wanted to up my rating on it.More random words now to meet the quota and even more and more and more. Still not there yet so I will keep rambling on and on and on and on. The v fronts of power is improving also although at episode 5 I only give it a six but I have good for that also."
"I was overly excited about watching this because of how much I really loved Game of Thrones. But I have never been so disappointed in myself for being so excited for something. I went from falling in love with so many characters in GoT to thinking that this was going to be great too, how stupid I was. I couldn't care less about anyone except Viscerys, I didn't like the ""story"" if you could call it that, I didn't like the characters and I definitely didn't like the lack of dragons.I was so bored by House of The Dragons, it's honestly hard to believe that it has anything to do with Game of Thrones, it's like it's a poorly written Fan Fiction. Me and my fiance SUFFERED through to the end of this God awful soap opera and I have to say this, DON'T DO IT.Any character that you may come to like turns out to be someone intolerable, and any good character that is likeable is barely seen then dies. Almost every one was so one dimensional, lacked any sort of passion, emotional intelligence or quirks. It was basically a 10 hour argument of who should sit on the spikey chair, this illegitimate bastard, or this other illegitimate bastard? Or maybe this other one that refuses to be King? Or perhaps the most annoying female character in the series?Not only was it incredibly boring but it made no sense whatsoever. And just when you think to yourself, oh something exciting is about to happen, you're wrong, it's not.I would not recommend this, not even for the die hard GoT fans, I think you'll be the most disappointed in it actually. At least, you should be at this dishonourable, deplorable heaping pile of garbage. Though to be fair, the dragons are beautiful and have more personality then a majority of the characters but you'll barely see them.I wanted to feel bad, I really did. I cried floods of tears for Jorah, Benjen, Theon and the dragons in Game of Thrones and this? THIS? I felt nothing even for poor Viscerys, I did really like him but because it lacked such heart, I didn't even feel teary eyed.We finally reached the final episode at which I exclaimed, how? As in how is there another episode but I held onto some hope that being the last episode there might be substance, might be something to be able to say it was worth it but it let me down like the rest of the episodes.The only reason I gave this two stars was because dragons and Viscerys and a little bit for Laenor.I genuinely don't know how anyone could have given this any more than two stars, and that's quite generous. I noticed that it was only listed as a drama and I can tell why, it lacked any of the substance that GoT had. At least there was laughs to be had, epic battles, decent enough sex and death scenes, the characters (mostly) had interesting and exciting story lines. But this..save a few, had the most boring and unrelatable characters in it and to be honest it feels like this was made in an attempt to make more money and nothing else. It lacked soul and lacked heart. Even with the ""sombre"" and ""pensive"" music as described by the subtitles, I felt so completely detached by the end.Oh, there was that one good moment with the table and the lava like material being poured into it, that was pretty cool.I don't know how there could possibly be a season two coming. How, just...how?.The last ten minutes of the ENTIRE season, doesn't make up for how bored I was for the most part and when I wasn't bored it was because I checked out.My fiance and I made this joke where every scene was glaring, looking, talking, glaring, talking, more glaring. And it's true, there's no decent fight, no war, no excitement and no questioning who was good and who was bad.Seasons that come to an end usually have this cliff hanger moment, that moment where you're questioning what next? All I was thinking was surely it's a joke that there is another season because no matter how good it may be, this first season has set it up for no hope that it will get better.Parting words. I really really dislike this boring, tedious nonsense."
"I have immensely enjoyed GRRM's ASOIAF work outside of the GoT-based narratives. The Dunk and Egg novellas and Fire and Blood both succeeded, as far as I'm concerned, in allowing us to peer past - and underneath - the stories of Daenerys and Jon, Arya, Tyrion etc. And to realize that the world there has so much to offer. We like jousts, melees, committing to memory the names and lineages of the great and lesser noble houses, their courtly romances, intrigues, and yeah, dragons too. Sure. And all that, in addition to the well-wrought characters of GoT is what allowed the original show to go so wide so fast and enjoy such mass appeal to begin with.I was holding out hope for this but refused to get too excited for all the obvious reasons. With this week's foray into what is arguably a much more compelling time in Westeros's history, I really cannot temper my expectations any more. I had been waiting for a chance to get a better sense of the writing and the cast-chemistry, both of which did not disappoint. Within 30 minutes, I was alarmingly invested. Having a good idea of where this is headed, I do not fear this devolving into tedium and disorder. At all. I just hope they take their time and let us enjoy this world - it's such a brilliant one."
"The visuals, the attention to detail, the pacing, the music and the script, it all comes together spectacularly! No expense was spared for the premier episode and it was as close to perfection as any director and producer could hope for. HBO once again proving they are a class apart."
"SEE! You CAN have a girl-power theme without being condescendingly woke. I enjoyed episode 1 and look forward to the show runners' vision coming to screen. This show has earned back my HBO Max subscription. But beware, if you go off the deep end of woke, I and many others will be gone."
"Just wow!! Can't believe I'm saying this but this is even better than its predecessor. The acting, music, set design and everything else is simply breathtaking. I'm in."
"Everyone is complaining for one reason or another. GOT season 1 wasn't that interesting right off the bat either you Bad Mood Marys! Jeeezzz!! It's like you all expected some grand cinematic universe just based off of what you got with Game of Thrones. Need you remind you that you all are likely the same people who complained about Dani dying and the GOT ending. Y'all got the knee so bent you can't stand to see the potential. If you can't see the political unrest, you're blind. You complain stop rushing but then also complain it's moving to slow and is a ""slow burn."" So which is it?! Have mercy! Ok rant over.HOTD is telling the tale of HOUSE TARGARYEN and each of these characters actually being apart of these other houses as well. We didn't see that with GOT because of the reputation the Targaryen dynasty has built from the Mad King, and you never got to see them if they had been intertwined with the other houses and now you do. I'm intrigued if the premise of keeping their blood lines ""pure"" was started in this chapter of the story. It's clear that the stage is almost being set that way. You see the insanity that has always existed behind House Hightower and what that potential is, first in Alicent's father now in her. Then you have these introductions if characters out to essentially get Rhaenyra in either an attempt to glean something from Alicent, to remover from power because of her gender, or sheerly out of a grudge. So how does that change if she's the first in her line to fall for a family member. How does her father seeing that as a ""stain on their house"" then potential become the enemy of his own house and family. There is so much to tell and learn and you're all being too hard on the show. It's being well written and it would be a soap opera if we solely had the writers focusing on these 3 small houses and their paramours. We came into GOT with the drama of literally every damn house right off the bat. You actually have storytelling taking place that discussed the build up to that level of insanity. You need to calm down, be patient, and let the storytellers tell the tale. You forget that every jab you take at this show you're taking that same jab at an author whose story you were obsessed with and whose world you craved. You probably haven't even read the books so you can't appreciate the art of the story as it's written anyway. So calm down and keep watching or tune out and hush."
"Reading some of the reviews just shows how some people have no idea how to character build, they obviously were not fans of the original GOT, I thought it was a great opening episode and looking forward to the rest of the season."
"After the catastrophic ending of GOT i have been holding my breath for this one, but i think they have done a good job! The story unfolds naturally and we are introduced to the different houses, characters and lurking problems/conflicts above and below the surface.Good acting from the crew. Nice editing af directing. All in all a very good start to a series i am looking forward to !"
"I've waited until half way through season 1 to write this review to give it every chance. Mixed feelings - I think the acting is great overall, visually superb and I'm intrigued as to where the story is going (I've not read the books, but was a huge fan of GOT until the last season). I feel the rushing through time is affecting the character development and ability to let the political games grow and play out well. The drama we have had so far hasn't had the impact I feel it could have had if more time was given to let those character connections grow. More could have been done for example to build up to the crab feeder battle, it just sort of came and went instantly without really feeling invested in it at all. If what we've seen so far was fleshed out to at least a full season, we could have seen more plot development in the political side as well as a better lead up to that battle.A big jump in time coming up, not sure how that's going to go as i've just started to really appreciate the younger actresses, and now they're finished. Initially I preferred Rhaenyra but in the last couple of episodes I've been leaning more to Alicent, left me wanting more from her which is a shame for the actress as I think she was just coming into her own now. I hope the pace slows a bit now they're switching to the older actresses, 6/10 so far imo."
"Excellent pilot, I loved the introduction to this new series! The setting, the music and the characters are all familiar, paying an homage to the original show but still holding its own.I terribly missed Westeros and House of the Dragon is extremely promising.We have the usual mix of gore and nudity of course, but what made thrones great is all the power hungry individuals that stopped at nothing to claim it. We do see the seeds of that and all the casting was on point. Ramin's music score is still brilliant, and I loved the credits scene (albeit too short).Matt Smith is perfection and I for one am really excited to see what HBO has in store for us!!"
"While this is a good show, it's hard to determine if it's good because we all loved Game of Thrones or if it's good on its own. The show's biggest advantage, adaptation wise, is that its source material is COMPLETE. Unlike GOT we - hopefully - won't have to deal with sloppy, off-book showrunner writing that damaged the later seasons of House of the Dragon's predecessor. Fire & Blood has always reminded me of the appendices of Lord of the Rings and I love the potential that gives House of the Dragon.What is clear from the first shot after the opening expository scene is that HotD came with a big budget and intended to use it. Seeing a Targaryen swoop through the clouds, down to the Red Keep and fly over the heads of completely unbothered King's Landing residents was impressive. But as the show progressed it felt at times like the inclusion of a dragon in some scenes (the coronation for example) was more spectacular than narrative.Then, there's the time jumps and recasting. Granted, the casting was excellent - but even well-cast actors can only do their best with what they're given (to paraphrase the late Lady Crane.) Character development was nearly impossible when the characters are dramatically aged just when they are getting in the groove of their storylines. Even Matt Smith - whose Prince Daemon is never recast - doesn't arc so much as zizags from one extreme personality to the next.The entire season felt like setting up a chessboard (one side black, the other green) which isn't necessarily a bad thing unless you throw the pieces out and switch to checkers halfway through. Fingers crossed that House of the Dragon's sophomore season learns from its mistakes and goes for character development over special effects."
"4 episodes is enough time to have an opinion of how a series is evolving and if it's going to be a real Blockbuster. We can all agree that it is very difficult to beat one of the greatest series of all times, and even worse if you try to do it with a prequel. Having said that, after 4 episodes we can assert that NOTHING IS HAPPENING! You can have great costumes, spectacular locations, astonishing special effects, you can even have dragons, but if you don't have a STORY, you will never convince your audience and you will have a mediocre result. A very expensive one. So I really hope the 5th episode shifts things up or HBO will have the most expensive soap opera of all times."
"The first few episodes had me pretty well hooked, some great actors and a compelling story line of political intrigue seemed to promise much. Unfortunately by episode 6 I found it had slowed into an extremely dialogue-heavy tale of poorly-established new characters introduced in one of many confusing time jumps and the latest episode is shot in near-total darkness to the extent that I honestly cannot see a single thing on the screen. I could be watching an episode of Happy Days for all I know, all I see is blackness accompanied by sounds of footsteps and whispered incoherent speech. I can't tell what's happening, where it's happening, who's doing what or why.Recommended if you like shows about someone whispering in pitch darkness.I'll give it one more episode then I think I'm out until someone finds the light switch."
Ignore 1/2 star reviews .they're just bunch of clown. Pretty good start.As book readers this is all I want
The character was great
And the actors too.
"This is how you win your fan base back. After several years, Game of Thrones had a pitch fork stuck inside it. Unlike The Terminator Franchise the series pulled a John Snow. Apparently John Snow does know a thing or two about pleasing the fans.The production works is fantasic, the costumes are delicious, the acting is standard HBO, in other words, terrific. Where Amazon has inexperience and hubris, HBO has experience and course correction. HBO is showing how to make a show and do it right.If the series can end on a high note by pleasing most fan and if GRRM can actually finish the next book. The franchise, including GRRM's repuation just might be a pin's hair from saving. Which is ultimately incredible how they pulled a last hail mary. Time will tell. After all Hollywood is known for it's hubris and foolishness.Disney had the Mandalorian, which saved the franchise, only to bring forth more terrible writing and two back to back terrible shows in Boba Fett and Obi Wan.EDIT: I'm getting downvoted by Rings of Power fans. Go back to your Amazon protected show, where they have to delete ratings 6/10 and below."
This is the best job after Game of Thrones.I liked the character's perspective and the courage of Damon and the king made me laugh when he sacrificed his wife for his son and then his son died.
"I have been turning in every monday, and until episode 6 i have been dissatisfied. Now i get real hope that we will get episodes wich will live up to the GoT series. And also for adults, i was feeling like i was watching some teenager series until now. I absolutely hated the whining rhaenyra and also the queen what ever her name was, being a problem taking them seriously. Having the best dad in the world seeing as this was before equality i presume, she goes on and on being a little b*tch making me want to rip her head off. Shes seemingly still a littlebit unlikeable"" character with the actor switch, but this actor atleast have the skills, looks and depth to pull off the persona. Same can be Said about the queen."
"So many people are complaining that HotD is bad because it comes off like a soap opera. I wonder if these people have read the source material. ""Fire and Blood"" and especially The Dance of the Dragon IS a soap opera.It's all about who's got the better of whom by playing smarter than the other party, people are constantly conspiring, turning on each other. It's all a big powerplay, played out with love, blood and betrayal. And so far I think the show is doing really well in covering exactly that. Also it looks beautiful and the dragons are awesomeAnd - not to spoil anything - but going by the book, it's gonna get A LOT bloodier very soon and a lot more complex in terms of who's on whose side."
"Hearing familiar soundtracks was nice, but it also reminds me of season 8 and it makes me not really want to continue watching the show. I will anyway.I feel like this will like what Better Call Saul is to Breaking Bad. A great show to a masterpiece (bar s8). It's still a shame knowing how squandered the ending to this world (at least on TV) will be."
"I watched the whole season in one day and the end seems to be very sudden. Just like how some things changed very sudden. They are older suddenly, but they do not look older. The only person who aged a lot was the king. I did not follow the story very good, but maybe some people have good genes or something? Or there is a magical potion?Maybe I must watch it all again, because for me there was much confusing. Who is he again? How did he look like before? Where are we? Which storyline is this? I have the feeling they leave bit out of it, so you must figure it out yourself by watching.First it is a story about how you can live as a woman. That you have no life at all and you are a political object and you must make babies. And ofcourse there is a king who agrees with that and there must be a woman in power.First the king is angry that the uncle is kissing his daugther, but after a few years it is no problem that she kills off her husband and marries her uncle. Everybody thinks it is normal. And it is also normal that your husband is shouting at you and you are being chocked at the same time. No problem at all. Or that is someone is beaten to death on a party: why explain and talk about that? I think they are not explaning things to make it more complex. But the story is not very complex at all. The king cannot get what he wants, so he starts to do crazy things etc.But luckily there are dragons... In the beginnen everything looked fake (yes they are, I know...) but it was like bad cgi. But later on it was better I think or I did not pay attention anymore. Especially with the dragons I noticed something was off. Anyway they looked nice and detailed and the more I see them the more I did not like them at all... It was just a snake with big legs and big blankets like wings. I don't know why I am thinking like that.Anyway, I like that there are more dragons and you can see what they can do... Well not so much... They can use fire and they can bite. I expected a bit more from the dragons. Like how to bound with the dragon, how the dragon thinks and feels, why is he doing the things like he is doing, how do you learn him tricks and why is he not having a big human BBQ? It was nice to see in the end that the dragons were not listening to the humans.There are no big battles, there is nothing much special happening. Yes the 'hero' can take many arrows, also one in the leg. And after a while he can run after the enemy. But I must say, there is not really much where I think: this is stupid or too much Hollywood. But I think the naked stuff and violence is a lot tuned down and mostly also not needed. Cutthing a head off to show his tongue...Another thing is thing is the marriages and incest. And still the actor changes.I could not build a connection with characters, also because there are much one dimensional. I have no clue why they are doing things, why are they angry, why iare they thinking like that etc. They can go very fast and very slow... Please king... Why don't you die? What's taking so long? Just go so we can continue.So the costumes are nice and I like that the people of the city are only there to get money from and use them to be popular. But where are the political games? The fighting for land? The relations etc. I miss that. So it seems like they just continued with the same quality as the last season of GoT.So do I want a second season? I do not feel the need for it. Will I watch it? I think so... It is not really bad. Who knows it will be better?"
"This show seems to be great at several things: worldbuilding, writing, acting, and a once again an incredible score. The first episode was not perfect, but it did an astounding job at giving the audience just enough information to get a feel for each character without reveling too much too soon. All in all, it has the potential to be better than GoT but it is far too soon to tell. It is 100% worth a watch however, particularly if you were a fan of the earlier seasons of GoT."
"To be honest with you all house of dragons is not even close to be called a sequel or even prequel to game of thrones it's merely a bad representation to the story, because when we talk about game of thrones for example we say yea it has a great main story that we follow as an audience but also there alot of great mini stories behind every character in the show that keeps you connected and interested in all of them there is amazing acting performance from all the cast that keeps you in the mood of the story and the show even after every episode ends there is an unbelievable visual and sound effects throughout the entire show and at last there is great directing to the whole work to get it to as amazing work of art as it was but when we get to speak about house of dragons we can't say that there is great main story or dialogue there is not that much interesting characters on the show or any mini background stories even to begin with there is not that great acting performance that's worthy of the story and the visual and sound effects not up to the level simply to say and the director was not that successful to bring forward a great show tied together with all that he got and the inserting of the nudity and porngraphy scenes in a way that it's even pushed over the show without context or necessarily importance to the events for just to compensate the lacking of every other aspect that the show missing of great drama or thrilling event's on the there is no worthy action or adventure or thriller or drama in the show worthy of it to be a prequel to the great eventful game of thrones."
"This show just keeps getting worse, and after 4 episodes I no longer care. Although these fake ratings are pretty entertaining, looks like HBO employees are blitzing this board to keep the ratings aloft. Thank the lord for all these negative reviews for the reality check, its that bad.Casting could not be worse top to bottom, the brooding prince was the only cast member they got right, the king is a pantywaist sissy, he ain't scaring anybody and he sure as hell isn't inspiring any loyalty. The scene with the buck is guaranteed to make you sick, is this how liberals hunt?Bad scriptwriting and lower standards of CGI make for a certified snoozefest. And BTW I cancelled my HBO subscription on Monday, they have nothing left."
"Watching this is like reconnecting with a former friend who let you down very badly, but you give them a second chance, trusting that they won't hurt you again. Given that it's set a few centuries before the events of GOT with completely different characters, I'll judge it on its own merits."
"I read most of the reviews last week when this show aired, there were a lot of negative remarks and comparisons to the original GOT. I think it's really immature way to judge a show to compare it to another show that came before it, every show should be judged on its own merits.I think ""House of Dragons"" shows promise, but it's too early to judge it and compare it to the previous cast or the story. This time is supposed to be 172 years ago, I don't know how people can even call this a prequel to GOT when there is over a century of difference in time?.This show so far seems to be more focused on succession and the politics behind it. My first impression of the casting of ""Milly Alcock"" as Princess Rhaenyra is that she is perfect for the role, this girl has charisma and presence without even talking. I was even more impressed with her in the second episode.I would say the same about the rest of the cast particularly Paddy Considine as the King and Rhys Ifans as Otto, who are both caliber actors. What I am trying to understand is the character of ""Lord Corlys Velaryon"" played by Steve Toussaint, as I don't recall any black ""Velaryon"" family or Targaryen in the Westros in GOT?. I don't know if this is another ""woke"" thing?.I think the core theme of ""House of Dragons"" is more about the struggle of a woman to become a Queen, something that has never been done before in the patriarchy of the Targaryen and seven kingdoms. Although there is this strong defiance by Daemon Targaryen to accept that his brother denied him to be his heir, that he could become the enemy. However, I believe Daemon loves his family and especially Rhaenyra and he is actually her only true ally.If you are going to watch ""House of Dragons"" and compare every character to the original GOT and keep looking for faults, then I suggest stopping watching it altogether, because this show does not measure up to your standards. George R. R. Martin is now more involved with this show and has more control than he did with GOT, and let's not forget how the two opportunist ""David Benioff"" and ""D. B. Weiss"" destroyed the last season of GOT. I am glad Martin is no longer tied to those two scumbags, so I have faith ""House of Dragons"" will be a great success and prove many wrong."
It's everything a fan of Asoiaf would want. I never thought there would be a show to rival Game of Thrones but House of The Dragon is it! Must watch TV every Sunday night.
"As a huge fan of the original series, I see two major complaints in the reviews that I had also noticed-less slow moving political intrigue and the move to different, older actors. First off, this King has just ruled over an unprecedented long period of peace due to Dragons. The chaos will come when he passes and the game of thrones begins. As for moving to different actors so quickly, I'm also disappointed because a few had just grown on me. But we'll see about that choice being made so early. Other than that, it's great, much better than other tentpole offerings like the LOTR show and must watch."
"I was worried they would try to be their own thing too much, but they even used the original main theme song of GOT, they mentioned ice and fire, the throne is closer to what it's supposed to look like but also not a completely different set up- I've missed this world and I'm excited to obsess over this for the next upcoming ten weeks!"
"I know Game of Thrones ended in disaster. It certainly killed the franchise, however, the show was one of the all time greats before the last season.House of the Dragon so far, has a similar feel to the Game of Thrones franchise, and I'm excited to see where they go with this show. It has potential to make the history books.The action scenes are very well done, and I am constantly on the edge of my seat wondering what is going to happen. My trauma from Game of Thrones has taught me to expect the worst, and I cannot help but constantly be on guard throughout watching this show.So far the acting is phenomenal, and the special effects are amazing. The writing is also very well done in gripping you into the show immediately. This show has amazing potential, and I'm here for it.So far, it has certainly been one of the best releases of the year."
"Just watched her in Episode 1. I think the casting of Milly Alcock is wrong. She looks about 12yrs old, very childlike features. Unbelievable as the heir to the throne. She also does not have the beauty and charisma that Emilia Clarke had, or her commanding presence on screen. She just hasn't got it. On the plus side Matt Smith was great and carried the show!"
"This show makes up for two year wait and the below average last season of GoT. The CGI is simply amazing, and needlessly to mention the episodes have been written under George RR Martins supervision and Migual Sapochnik who first directed the battle of the bastards episode. This show is by far the best television on the Tv right now and I simply can't wait to see what's coming."
"Slow beginning, predictable and tried to death narrative of a power struggle between elites. But nice set, some great acting, and less woke nonsense.If they casted Lord Corlys Velaryon as someone from a fantastical place where people of his skin are predominantly from, with an amazing non native accent then his character would be more interesting. Instead, he stands out like a sore thumb and it come across as a diversity hire. Horrible.Let's see how it all plays out."
"I finally gave up watching this during episode five. I just don't care about any of the characters or anything that is happening. House of the Dragon feels like the modern equivalent of the Phantom Menace.I haven't read the book(s?) its based on so maybe there's all sorts of great things that are going to happen at some point but, judging by what I've seen so far, no amount of great storylines are going to save this TV show from whoever is responsible for the complete mess I've seen so far.I've read that it gets even worse in episode six but I don't have the patience to get that far. Waste of a good cast too."
"The writing keeps you engaged and it pulls you into the story. I am grateful it is a finished story this time, so the producers can't mess it up. Lol. Really curious where it will go :)The world building feels authentic, not try-hard for what they had before.It is visually stunning. Especially as an artist I love that the costumes and visuals are so deeply invested in. The acting feels believable so far. Maybe they can redeem the final failure of game of thrones and Martin will finally finish his last book. Lol.The world building is distinct and not too cookie cutter of a fantasy in presentation."
I absolutely love this show. The special effects are as awesome as ever and the storyline is superior. GRRM is such an excellent writer. The number of viewers are off the chart! So happy to be back in Westeros.Dameon is the character you love to hate! But yet there are things about him I love. Matt Smith has been simply excellent playing this character. Thank you to the young actresses Emily and Milly! What an awesomely performance by both of you.The show is successfully setting up the story of which we are still in the very beginnings. Hold on to your dragons the story is going to grip you in so many ways.
"Only one episode in but i can already see the brilliant minds behind the directing and writing.There is a lot to see in the background and foreground you might miss on the first pass but there are people on YouTube who have broken it down and still show me things after i watched it a couple of times!You can form opinions of future events relative to subtle hints throughout the show and weather or not they bear fruit later on is half the excitement.Pace is nice, i know they had to cram in a lot of character development into one hour but i can see it branching off from here and creating lots of separate interesting storylines that will no doubt finally converge towards the shows finale.Lets hope they keep it up and don't dive into GoT season 6 and beyond style of fast paced rubbish!"
"Early I know, but this episode was a breath of fresh and familiar air all at once. Excited for episode 2. They did a phenomenal Job of setting everything up for the rest of the show."
"Its a briliant first episode. Its very well fisrt step of the series to build a story become more intent. I love the characters, the dialogs, the scenes, and the fight scenes. I love how the dragon moves and roars. I can't wait for the next more episodes. Very Recomended. Its wort to watch."
"The plot is amazing. A series to watch. I loved it. I will recommend this series to everyone here to please and please watch it. The first episode is perfect! The central theme of this series is SUCCESSION and the issue of male primogeniture - and this is beautifully set up with the opening scene showing the Great Council in 101 AC. A short intro but important to understand why Rhaneyra being chosen as heir spells a dark shadow that will carry through the episodes to come. As a book reader, I was greatly surprised in a positive way by how the showrunners enriched the book either by adding extra stories or elaborating on one aspects which were not in the book. I'm a huge book fan so like lots of others I was a little worried about this show after the appalling ending of Game of Thrones, however the first episode has left me excited to see more.It was great to be back in Westeros and see characters brought to life that I'd only read about in Fire and Blood and a Song of Ice and Fire.Keeping up with the tradition of Thrones its bloody in some parts and there are a few Easter Eggs referencing the original series.The cast are all superb so far, costumes and sets are decadent and look fantastic."
"I loved Game of Thrones. So many memorable characters, excellent writing throughout the majority of the series. Twists, turns, intrigue. GoT had it all. Unfortunately, HoD is rather predictable - and if it were not for Matt Smith, the show would be a snoozer. He and his character Daemon stand out above all of the others on both talent and sheer entertainment value.I consider this more of a ""toned down"" Game of Thrones thus far. It's definitely not a bad show by any means. It's just not on the level of greatness as it's predecessor (successor?). I'm definitely looking forward to the Dance of Dragons bit, that may possibly adjust my rating on the series. We shall see."
"I absolutely loved this, I'm so happy to back in this world, people stating on here bots are writing how great this is, I'm no bot, and I thought the first episode so far was fantastic, it feels similar but different, I couldn't be more pleased so far with the show, I wasn't disappointed. I can't wait to see more."
"A prequel to an epic like GOT is going to need a few episodes to settle into its own. This show has promise, and by the end of second episode, it's getting some traction.Sure, production quality feels a little uneven, which surprised me given its hefty budget compared to GOT. And the casting choices leave some things to be desired. But we were so invested in GOT actors and the characters that were fully developed over so many years, a new cast is bound to feel shallow and flat at the start. Still, aside from Matt Smith and Rhys Ifans, maybe they could have done a bit better?Still, I hope this show will be a redemption of GoT's dismal final season."
"It is so boring I couldn't watch the last episode at one go. It is full of unnecessary scenes. The pictures are good and the graphics, but what is the valie of good graphics if they were done by bad actors and stupid scenario. I hate to say it but this show is completely a no for me and I will not continue watching it. In fact I am going to return my subscription to sky and hbo I am really and deeply bored"
"This is worst than the worst show I have ever watched. It is so deeply slow a crawling turtle would run it, it is so slow it can be outrun by a one day old baby trying to run onw k meter fgggs."
"Literally Anthor masterpiece.The soundtracks and the world of the song ice and fire, DRAGONS!!!!And the story is good and the characters, i hope they dont take a lot of years to make the the next seasons."
"The first episode was the perfect start for this show that carries such a big name.There is to many characters which i liked, the writing is so strong that makes none can mixup between the characters.I loved this start they have done an amazing work"
10/10.
"As a huge fan of GoT, I think this episode was great introduction to the story. Cinematography and Visual Effects were phenomenal. I hope this series will get better and better story wise. Casting is also perfect. I like matt smith, He is a best choise for the Daemon Targaryen."
"Yeah it's going a bit fast with the cast and story telling but I mean is not like the book has a lot content before the start of the dance of dragons.I have no complains from the actors at all, Idk what Is the fuzz about? Milly Alcock has done great job so have olivia Cooke and Emma D'Arcy.But sincerely I think the main director leavin the show is a bummer let's hope the second season continues the hype of house of the dragon.Love the dragons tho! (literally the only reason I watch thet show) veghar is so HUGE! Can't even imagen who big Balerion the black dread was. Caraxes is also cool looking."
"A change of actors in the sixth episode + a jump into the future of 10 years + arranged marriages + former and new loves... It is impossible to understand who is with whom and how. This TV series is quite a failure. A combination of SF drama and telenovela. The action is slow, drawn out, has no dynamics. I am watching this TV series and ""The Rings of Power"" in parallel and I have to say that the ratings should be switched. I can't believe that people are so superficial and give a rating in advance, based on their expectation and not based on the conclusion of what they watched. 7.0 - 7.5/10 so far, no material for 8.0+/10."
"I've just finished watching the season 1 finale and I have to say I am very impressed with House of the Dragon. After the mess that is season 8 of Game of Thrones I had lost all faith in any potential prequels, spin-offs etc. But I am so glad I gave this one a chance.I don't think I can say it is quite as good as season 1 of GoT, but what I can say is that season 1 of HotD is a great quality and solid first season, surpassing the quality of most tv shows.I will go through the slight issues I had with it before giving it praise.Cons:1. Time-jumps: whilst I appreciated it was to initially give us the important events leading up to where we are now, I did feel it was a little jumpy and rushed at times. I think I would have appreciated a more fleshed out lead up. But I get why they chose to do it like this.2. Good v Bad guys: I can't help but think they're painting the greens to be all bad, and blacks to be all good. I prefer to see complexity in characters; that's something GoT did so well. I have not read Fire and Blood so forgive me if it is so black and white in terms of who is good and who is bad in the book.3. There are some questionable CGI moments for such a high budget HBO show. However... there are also some fantastic visuals, especially in the finale.Pros:1. Acting: Everyone is amazing. Both young and 'old' Rhaenyra and Alicent are incredible actors. I have to give it to Emma and Olivia- I was hesitant about the change in actors but they quickly proved that they could hold their own. Paddy as Viserys was amazing. Same goes for Matt Smith as Daemon. Casting all around is flawless in my opinion.2. Dragons: Whilst I would have liked to see a bit more of the dragons in some episodes, the dragon designs we do see are incredible and unique.3. Music: this gets better and better each episode. Beautiful.4. Writing: excellent writing and dialogue throughout. It really matches GoT on the most part.5. Cinematography: the camera work and (most) visuals are flawless. Especially in the finale.6. Plot: A great, tense and intriguing story. Very impressed.Overall, this TV show has started off incredible, with a lot of potential to continue into one of the best TV shows of all time.Most episodes I gave a 9, with episode 7,8,10 as 10/10s."
"This first season had its moments. Despite the last episodes, I still feel that GoT might be the best series of all time. How can you make a prequel without creating high expectations? They were high of course, and everything they feed us will always feel smaller and weaker.One thing that really bothers me is that the dialogues and ""eye2eye duels"" are no longer smart and deep. It really feels like a Portuguese novela at times.Next season should bring better character development, stronger personalities and smart moves from all the players. I am guessing that was why it used to be called Game of Thrones. It should be a game for the throne with many great candidates to get there."
"So I've watched every episode of this show and all I can say is, it's just boring, in fact you know what it reminds me of? Have you ever seen those board games like Dungeons and Dragons, where you have one person set the stage and everyone else move their pieces one at a time while tossing dice on squares. This is exactly that, you have a king and everyone around him wants the crown. And they'll spend endless episodes whining about how it should have been theirs. And how they deserve it, and how everyone else has been bad to them. And it's just endless whining.I can't understand how they went from the Game of Thrones to this lackluster and sad rendition of who wants the crown more. And you know what the truly sad part is? It MIGHT have been ok if they had a few characters that were likable, and aged with the show. But the only person that was likable to me was the princess, and what they managed to do is replace her with an ""older version"" of her like 5 episodes in. So there goes all the actor investment right out the window.3/10 we deserved much better than this.Final Update: It is now episode 9 in the first season, and I've stopped watching it about half way through, because I genuinely couldn't care less about anything that happens anymore in this series. This is a prime example of how you kill a series."
Short review:
An incredibly intriguing political piece and an emotionally intense drama set in a bitter-sweet fantasy world that you want more of than what the series offersLong review:
"This series builds upon all the experience of the Game of Thrones show we are all used to, but it also takes it to the next level. The intense dialogues and plots are back, now interwoven with exceptional cinematics, scenes, foresight and some incredibly deep and touching moments worthy of cinematic history. At a first sight some might perceive this series to be an echo of GoT but because of the increased quality of all the episodes all the way until it's foreboding climax in episode 10, this series claims the 9/10 score. The only thing lacking in this series is the pacing that sometimes feel a bit rushed, however, it is somewhat understandable as this entire first season is actually the prologue to the rest of the series - the actual meat of the story that we'll face in the next season. With that in mind I think this series does an exceptional job at rebuilding the previously broken relationship everyone had to GoT. And I mean you gotta feel with Viserys and his character arc, wow!The first season as a whole get a solid 9/10"
(The first few episodes had varied 8/10s with the second half climbing to solid 9s)PS I am very cautious on giving films high scores. The only films I've given 10/10 are The Lord of the Rings Trilogy & Princess Mononoke.
"Might change the rating as the season goes by.It seems like the people who gave low ratings did not read the books or not remember how the start of GOT was. As far as I remember, GOT took some time to hook the audience and it was only by the end of the first season that it started gaining heavy traction.Give the show a chance, people. Having read the books, I knew what I was getting into and the show started off pretty decent apart from the tourney scene(its supposed to have rules).Excited to see how they will show the sea snake and the prince of dragonstone in the future since their role in the books was superb."
"I liked how it really captured the book's vibe, the lore was respected and the writing is exceptional. Some acting could be better, but that does not make the show less interesting.The first 5 episodes have been exciting, even though the plot is a bit predictable, the events have a good progression line and most the actors have done a good job. All the Targaryens are very convincing about their personalities and their blood inheritance, you can see the desire for lust, violence and selfish behaviour in every one of them, absolute faithful to the original material.Having the focus mainly in the Targaryen house, the acting for the outside characters are less concerning, I find it acceptable for a 10 so far."
"It's one of the best Pilot episode in TV Series History. Nice pace, Character registration, Plot understanding. Great story telling. Visually it's beautiful and has more feature film feels. Loved the nostalgic music / background score. Great job HBO. L."
"First of all, you should consider this series as a spin-off of the prestigious series ""Game of Thrones"". So I've already accepted that the House of the Dragon is not as perfect as the first and original one. I believe that GOT has been the best shot and the most exciting part of the Song of Ice and Fire novel, of course regardless of the last season. It might be soon to judge the House of the Dragon, but we can partly criticize it. Compared to GOT, we are faced to fewer characters and surely a less comprehensive scenario. There are some defects here. For instance, in the first episode, the king dethroned the crowned prince, i.e. His brother, based on some ridiculous gossip. It wasn't convincing to me. To sum up, I think, HOTD is a fascinating series and it has enabled to satisfy the GOT fans to the most extent."
"I was hoping for something better, but the acting is not great. Especially the young princess is horribly weak.The story itself looks interesting so far, although I think we should forget the Games of Thrones and look at it as a complete different story.What bothers me though is the fact, that the studios have to be politically correct nowadays when choosing actors. I won't go into details...Another thing that came into my mind was that it looked like I was watching an episode of the Lord of the Rings and all the blond characters are elves.I sincerely hope that the series are getting better."
"I only wish I could have seen it !! I understand now why some of the characters have platinum hair so they could be seen in the gloom !. Am I alone in saying its virtually impossible to watch during daylight hours, so its a night time view with all the lights out, and even then its hard to distinguish who is who, especially in episode 6 where there is a cast change. Don't Directors care when they see the daily rushes that we want to see the action, not just hear it ???? At least GoT had a lot of outdoor action during daylight, but its to be seen whether I'll stay the pace. Sorry but vague candlelight with only the vague outline of cast members is not an enjoyable experience."
"I really enjoyed the first episode. Not that much happens, but it rarely does in a pilot episode really. I enjoyed the introduction to the characters and beginning the story.There's a particular scene (you'll know it when you see it) that I can do without ever seeing again in my life. While I appreciate it from the story line perspective, once was more than enough.Deamon (Matt Smith) so far feels like a cross between little finger and Ramsey. I'm interested to see where this goes."
What makes different between good story and bad story is that the good one makes sense based on logical events not coincidence
So when u makes the main reasons for the next big war that we will see on just seveareal coincidence not just one I think that weaken the story
"I can't wait for next season I hope that will be more focus on dragons, dragonpets in KingslandING and dragonstone also the dragon keepers plzz more scene about that how they behave how is the relationship between the dragons, I mean this show is about house of the dragon and we know that all the dragons will be dead so we need to be sympathized with dragons.Despite my fears I think it's a good, tight story that they won't be able to mess with.Hope next season will be soon ."
"I was a big fan of GoT, especially the books. House of the Dragon is absolutely nothing like GoT.GoT had multiple plotlines and a wide variety of characters that were interesting and well developed and had their own journeys. House of the Dragon follows a handful of characters and focuses only on a single plotline. However despite spending so much time on a few characters they are dull and uninteresting.After being disappointed by the start, I took a break after episode 3 and then watched eps 4 and 5 back-to-back but found myself even less interested than I had been before. There's no action, the show is just palace ""intrigue"" although none of it is actually intriguing.The show is dull, insipid and uninspired and I'm just not interested in watching any more of it."
"It was just like the flow of GOT, from the starting we can feel that. As they promised it was really making the audience into the scenes and the characters around this show was superb performance and there is nothing about the technical side of the show it pretty good. Overall i love it from the first episode awaiting for the upcoming 😍😍😍"
"I really don't understand the negative ratings, especially after only one episode. People complaining that is is not like GOT (its a different show guys), skin color and boring story line (after just one episode) are very unfair.I think this had a great start and I'm really looking forward to seeing more. Cast is strong, cinematography is beautiful.My only complain so far is the CGI which looks really fake in some shots but I'm sure that will be improved as time goes."
After watching the 1st episode I really feel that this series will give GOT fans a good insight in to the beginning to the rise and fall of house Targaryen.
"The first episode was in the best look for a opening to such a big series, the framework is impressive and the music is too chill, the cgi is good but not as got. I think its a promising series."
Definitely worth it for having this watched. It will carry you through the GOT nostalgia. Powerful characters and story lines. Nice cause the production decided to keep alive the Daenerys appearance and her wield spirit. Long live the Dragon!
The show already has an incredible build up and lots of content for only one episode as is! I have no doubts this show will keep people intrigued and with the show releasing new episodes each week it adds character and makes people wonder what the next episode will have.
"House of the Dragon is a show that I want to like more than I actually do at this moment.The world has a lot of depth, some of which the show has already tapped into, but the points of conflict are too eagerly confronted. Many people say it's boring, and to some degree its slow, but not because the scenes lack action; it's because there's too much action. The characters need space to ""breathe"" in order for us to fall in love or hate them. In other words, abrupt decisions don't pack a punch when every decision is abrupt; the show needs to slow down. Look at the first hour of Fellowship of the Ring or the first season of GoT; slow and steady wins the race. We do NOT need to see a dragon in every episode; this is cheap.The CGI isn't great, but it doesn't have to be IF the story focuses on the things that matter. Another reason why big isn't necessarily better.The cast doesn't really have the presence that I think they should if they're going to carry a show like this. The Directors could fix this with some good direction (duh), but I fear they don't have enough time for setups and therefore, not enough time to give the actors feedback. Unfortunately, it shows. Otto and Daemon are probably the most ""comfortable"" performances that I've seen so far.Rhaenyra is quite audibly a victim, because of course she has to be in order to show how men have ruined everything; entirely predictable and frankly a disservice to the character. This isn't the actor's fault; it's cheap writing (one of my biggest gripes).The soundtrack is familiar and strong; a score I typically listen to as I bathe.The Crab Feeder? I'd have accepted Tommy Wiseau for this antagonist (not actually, but the CF's role in this is bizarre and ""wtf"").The sex is toned down, which is good. Don't use it to sell your show or that will literally be the ""mark of the beast"" on it for its entire run. That said, I don't disagree with placing it here and there. It does have purpose.The gore is brutal for the sake of brutality; not because the circumstances call for it. It's not shocking....it's just kind of there.The production design is really well done, though I do wish the places looked more lived in. Even the cast looks a little too good looking sometimes....make this violent world believable.HotD gets a 6 from me because it has a lot of room to grow; an awful lot. There are some cliches that I really really hate to see, and I really don't know who I'm rooting for right now. That said, I'm happy to be back in this world, and I really think Miguel and George are capable of bringing this toward something great."
"The acting, casting, CGI are all great. We are finally seeing the ""game of thrones"" in the sense of the power disputes that everybody loved. Viewers haven't seen that for a while, ever since the disaster of Game of Thrones - that bare in mind, didn't start in Season 8, but reached its peak there.As in the beggining of GoT, some of the oufits and armours feel a little off. Nothing major, which I'm sure they will improve as the series goes on, and maintains this amazing quality.It's faithful to the source material, and presumably will be until GRRM is on board. But if GoT has taught anything, it's not how a series starts, but how it ends. Overall a really great experience, and the adaptation fantasy series to go to. Seeing that The Witcher and Rings of Power are absolutely botched and heading towards disaster, this is a breath of fresh air."
"The internal succession tale set in the time of Taragayern supremacy is a success in every way. All thanks to the fantastic acting performance by the whole cast who are the reason for the show's success. Paddy Considine, Emma D'Arcy and Olivia Cooke are the heart and soul of this grand epic tale. Supporting cast including Rhys Ifans, Matt Smith, Steve Toussaint and Eva Best adds to the strength of its strong impressive cast. Even Emily Carey and Mily Alcock have served their part in building the initial relationship between the characters. Emily Carey makes a strong performance just before the time jump which helped the series to gain back its momentum which was lost due to some average epsiodes. Visuals is another praise worthy factor that upholds this story. Whether it is the dragons or the landscapes, everything looks beautiful. Most of the episodes are well written especially the first one which stands superior to all others and the ones in the later half which are worth it. Certian episodes that turned into one man shows will satisfy fans of certian characters as it is a delight to watch favourite characters outsmart others. The Shakespeare style finale ending adds to the tension of the viewer which will surely be fruitful in the second season.House of Dragon is not free of cons, Starting from poor lighting in certian scenes to 2-3 average episodes the show is pulled back from being great. Mysaria's bad accent in the later half, long shot cgi evident scenes, Alock's inappropriate performance at times and time jump are other factors that became cons of the show.In the end, a well developed good beginning to the internal succession inside Taragayern family."
"This is truly a very very very bad show. It lacks charisma.I think all the people giving them high scores are simply romanticizing the memory of GoT which was a masterpiece.This show is so boring, you'll wake up an hour after it finished.No action, mostly drama (I wanna marry him but I can't,,, I wanna have a go with my uncle, but this is more important, lets dance...).Seriously - I'm thinking of giving it up.I don't understand the folks giving this show such high scores - it's like I'm seeing a different show then them.I hope that after 5 long and boring episodes there will be any development in the story and more action will be added."
People who give it negative reviews are comparing it too much to the original GoT. It didn't start off as captivating but it was good nonetheless. Try to watch this without comparing the entire time and you'll see that they're slowly putting pieces into place. The acting is very well done and I'm glad we get to see the world from this perspective. It has potential to be great.
"It's incredibly beautiful and I expect it will surpass Game of Thrones in the next episodes. Keep it up. I salute you. The first episode was literally devastating and I don't know what to say about Damon Tarkirin that he is spiteful and arrogant and does not accept losing even if he loses, he does not accept losing arrogant."
"By the title, I mean two things. Firstly, I think this first season is an example of more competent writing and story telling than the first season of GOTs. For example, in GOT D&D felt the need to constantly rush through many different scenes, and always end the episode in some form a of a cliff hanger to try and draw you into the next (there were rumours they were struggling to fill the 45 minute minimum run time for each episode, and I think it shows even in the first season). This show however, scenes are allowed to linger on the happiness, pain, majesty and terror of its characters, and on the awe-inspiring and beautiful vistas and landscapes of Westeros. No episode feels like it's struggling to fill a 45 minute slot, many are much longer. The writing is also confident enough in itself to not feel the need to rely on constant cliff hangars to pull you from one episode and the next, and that confidence is well placed. It's a very refreshing change of pace from most television today.Secondly, I mean that the source material is already finished, so there is no chance of a terrible dive in quality that we saw in GOT. Besides, the writers seem far more competent and confident story tellers in any case. So this is guaranteed to have a better ending than GOT."
"House of the dragon has hours where I am barely hanging on and yet other hours where I'm gripping the TV. Be inconsistency of this painfully slow over the orchestrated plot as well worth the slow burn. Moments of brilliance sometimes last seconds but have such a brilliant impact that they make you feel it in your bones. Carefully folded together. Once everything begins coming together around episode 7 and into 8 it really starts to get its feet.. just a few episodes ago I almost fell asleep during one of them. But outside of that it has been brilliant for the most part. I think it the pacing could improve greatly by not including irrelevant scenes and sticking only to those that are important. As a filmmaker myself I know the struggle between wanting to keep everything and having to purge much. But the show could do with purging just a little more and it could have received another star.For example season 1 episode 8 lord of the tides at 1 hour 20 seconds approximately, the scene where the king looks upon those around him it has a certain reaction which I will not disclose for the purposes of spoilers is absolute brilliance and captures hours of plot into one moment of incredible acting composure production and videography."
"Not expecting much after GoT's last season's disaster. However, I'm pleasantly surprised how captivating the world and plot are in HotD. Plus the dragons look amazing!From the first episode, I immediately feel empathetic towards the majority of characters, even the ones I knew will be ""rotten"" in the end. As per GoT tradition, the gray areas of morality are palpable and the indecision on whose camp you should be on is part of the allure (Currently on camp Rhaenyra!).The first two episodes just gave enough blood, gore, ohhhs, ahhhs and scheming in between all of it.Cons: lighting! Looks very dark!"
"Marvelous. Majestic. Magnificent. Magica.Game of Thrones fans who are in doubt whether to watch the show or not, PLEASE WATCH IT! Relieve your dear Westeros back. It will not disappoint you, I promise.I was looking forward to the show. Expected it to be great from what I watched from the trailers but Oh My God....it blew me away. I mean, I am still in awe and cannot even write properly. It is everything you expected it to be. You get everything in the first episode itself. Dialogue, Script, Strong characters, Beautiful Cinematography, Emotions, DRAGONS, everything. Really reminds us of Peak Game of Thrones.And Ramin Djwadi, oh we have missed you boy, we really missed you."
"And way too many names. Get pen and paper and draw a family tree. Because there are so many of them. And they get shuffled like cards in a poker game. Who is who and who with whom. The intention of being something else than Game of Thrones, something independent made it a Denver Clan of Westeros. A soap opera. The typical telenovela story, focused on a rivalry between two or more people or families in romance or business. The character development GoT stands in no comparison to any characters in House of Dragon. And the big time jump after half of the first season didn't help either. And while there is some tragedy in it, it can't compare with the death of Eddard Stark for example. Plus, the magic and those epic moments of Game of Thrones barely shine. It has to improve a lot to be a worthy successor."
"It would be a 10/10, the level of violence of the birth scene is completely uncalled for. Other scenes are are gruesome. So it's a 8/10. Otherwise it would be a 10/10, it's awesome."
"Ok well this definitely isn't an 8.8. Putting it on par with GOT which is leagues above this is silly.Decent writing, great scenery, all the backstabbing and politicking is being set up so I can see where this might get a lot better. You can tell George RR has his hands in it which is good.Unfortunately, the casting is just kinda meh like others have mentioned. Rhaenyra is basically just a Daenerys clone with a less cool story. The king is kind forgettable as well. So far the only character I find interesting is Daemon.I will say you're much better off spending your time on this fantasy instead of that poor excuse Amazon put out."
Rhaenyra's older casting does not do the younger actress Justice. She does not emulate the beauty and fire as the younger actress. Very upset with this choice and wish someone had used some common sense. The script in this story is lacking and I hope someone steps in to repair the damage being done to the lineage of this amazing story. Daemon is a perfectly casted character and screams protagonist. Did we use the same writer that botched the ending of the original GOT series? I am very happy with the subliminal affects of the iron chair on King Visery. I hope there are corrective actions with this series before it loses any further credibility.
"The first episode was pretty solid and laid a foundation for the upcoming season but you know, you can just review the episode and form an opinion on the show after watching the season and not giving out a 1 or a 10 after watching one episode."
"I found this show making me wait for the next episode while it gives me another storyline almost each episode.Characters seem to be in place and I can see how they change personalities while the story is moving. People are turning evil slowly, getting betrayed etc.I hope it doesn't end like the GoT, but that ending was somewhat a success because it's still beeing talked about.Not much action so far in the season yet it finds a way to make you wonder for the next episode.Seeing the actors change in a while will be bittersweet a little bit. Hope the new ones will be as good as current roles."
"The ONLY reason I gave this eight stars is because of the Dragon scenes.I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED by this series.It's DARK. VIOLENT. And BRUTTISH.(It's also LITERALLY DARK. Where was this series filmed - in an enormous closet?)Most of the episodes move along at a snail's pace, giving it a PLODDING feeling. That's because too many of the SCENES are TOO LONG, DRAGGING DOWN the TEMPO.Either POOR WRITING or POOR DIRECTING are to blame.I suspect that some DIRECTORS are SO IN LOVE with what they've shot they REFUSE TO SHORTEN any scenes to move the episode along more briskly. As a result, the series suffers.The BEST PART, of course is THE DRAGONS! They are perhaps the ONLY SAVING GRACE of this series.We CANNOT GET ENOUGH of the DRAGONS. But it's appropriate that the series shows them a little at a time, lest we get tired of seeing them.But WHO? (yes, WHO?) EVER gets TIRED of SEEING DRAGONS?Let's hope the next season (because, of course, there will be another season) is BETTERN WRITTEN, BETTER DIRECTED, AND USES BETTER LIGHTING!"
"Very engaging show! It started well, actors are doing great job, compelling build up of the story and introduction of characters is at reasonable speed revealing their characteristics and you already can point your favorites. You don't have to be GoT fun to love it, it is great in its own but if you are a fan of GoT is a gift you can to enjoy the story of a similar fashion. I find Milly Alcock very attractive for the role of the Rhaenyra Targaryen, but later Rhaenyra is played by Emma D'Arcy which I find unattractive so will see if it will be still good but slightly sad about they change Milly for Emma to be honest."
"I'm hooked! My only negative comment is that they don't release them fast enough!I was originally on the fence because of the game of thrones finale. I wasn't going to bother, but then I heard a few people in my office talk about it. Then everybody was talking about it, and finally after several recommendations I have it a try.The set design, the acting and the script... It's all coming together to shape up to be what I think is going to be an epic first season.Game of thrones left everyone with a salty taste after the finale and this feels like a come back of biblical potential.The books are finished this time so the source material is there. If anyone is on the fence because of the game of thrones finale, all I can say is don't be. Give this a try!Please don't mess this up, it's a flying start so far and I'm loving it!!"
"2 episodes in and it gives off that same political snake pit of dialogue we get with game of thrones. Very interesting look into the lives of the targarians as they squander there kingdom over petty hierarchies, much like real life. The cinematography is 10/10 excellent, the dialogue mixed with the score by Djawadi incredible! The sets, production, cast and crew all 10/10 incredible display! I'm on board and fully invested in this show now and can't wait for more !!! Absolutely my fav show going on rn!Being that this is pre-time skip and it already feels like iv watched two really good movies is all I need to keep going and give my trust to these creators, usually if the first two eps aren't really intriguing I may skip on the show or take a while to watch it... not here! Every Sunday night I'll be ready."
"I like everything about this series except for the jump in 10 years which took the characters forward that causes confusion and non fluid structure leading to disorientation. The start was a bit slow though. The characters are interesting and the spin off stories of them and how they interlace with the underlying storyline is good. The same violence, cruelly, debauchery and fascination with dragons can be seen here as in GOT. Keeps me interested enough to want season 2 to come fast. The visual effects and cast did a great job. It's hard to compete with GOT as so many have watched GOT with it's many seasons, loved it (though not the stupid ending). Is this prequel epic quality? Too early to say but it's certainly promising."
"Whoever thinks this show is good, thinks adding sugar to their coffee is taking a risk. This show is dull, boring, and a Zquil on steroids. They put 1 or 2 fighting scenes in each show. Those scenes last maybe 5 mins a piece. It's a 75 min show. That means it's 65 mins of people just talking and looking at each other. In GOT by the time it got to the fifth episode you were invested. The stories were there. You wanted to see what would happen with the stars. There 6 different things going on all interesting. House of the Dragon can't even get the one story they're telling to be interesting.The acting is wooden at best. I can't blame the actors when their directions seem to be You look disinterested and upset, you look confused and lost, you look scared and nervous and finally you just keep the same exact look on your face no matter what is happening. If you seen 2 episodes of the show, you know exactly what characters I'm talking about.This show is a wast of time and hype. I was disappointed in how GOT ended, but it didn't happen until the very last episode in the last 30 mins. This show has had 5 episodes and disappointed on each one. Don't waste your time."
"The Sequel is very promising and i am sure they gonna break it .From my perspective after episode 6 they started to rock .It's called absolute dominance , #1 series at the moment .Only thing they have to do don't take this show too fast and have some dragon fights then show will introduced to it's name .The series should have the clip of aegon the conqueror, public gonnaa love it , what a performance from all characters in the show , i would say this series is true masterpiece and gonna be #1 in imdb ratings . They should show the old rhanerya , she was best in the bussiness"
Waiting along for next one .
"Mixed feelings on this new series, how will 10 episodes will cover F&B and Dance of Dragons remains to be seen, I skimmed through Fire and Blood again,and was surprised that Episode one jumped straight into Chapter six, won't put any more spoilers in here as the writers have promised it will be faithful to the novels, there's enough meat in the novels to drag-on it out to a couple or more seasons but I hope not...we'll see...The actors and production values are sound enough to carry through to Aegon the Second's reign and the demise of the Dragon numbers.Well... episodes 5 and 6 became predictable with the time jump , unfortunately the characters portrayed have no moral compass and the actors aren't generating any empathy to the series as in the original game of thrones show,now just a series of blood and fire soaked events meh.....if this runs into a second season there will not be any surprises to thrill audiences that have read the books. Episode 9..wow!!!!...."
"brilliant ending, cinematic, no punches pulled...looking forward to Finale and next season..."
"Last week, I binged seasons 1-7 of GoT so those"
episodes are still very fresh in my mind and I am
"unaffected by rose tinted nostalgia.I've just watched episode 1 of House of the Dragon.How can I sum it up? So far, so good.The music is sufficiently different to be fresh while"
remaining recognizable. The production quality and
"cinematography are as expected - fantastic, epic and"
"awe inspiring, aside from a couple of excessively dark"
"scenes that were over and done with very quickly.There is gore aplenty. Nudity, vomit, sex and depravity.Incidental background humor. A promise of things to0"
Come.The casting seems to be on point - I saw no issue with
"any of the characters, and the leads were well chosen"
"for their roles.The writing seems to be up to par. As an introduction,"
this episode was written and directed well. I want to
see and know more - a good sign.So far I'm pleased with this return to the land of
Westeros. Valar morghulis!+
"The writing, acting, music, fight scenes, the costume design, effects(aside from the little dragons in ep6) are all top notch. They made the world feel older and different while obviously being mostly in the same location. Like most i did not like how the main show ended but i judge this as its own thing and it is great. The time jumps can be a bit jarring and seeing the young actors being replaced kinda sucked at first but the older actors did as much of a good job that in the end it didnt matter. Side note : I think episode 1 is an all time classic not being appreciated yet. It made the whole world fall in love with this epic fantasy universe all over again after that disaster season 8 of GoT. Hurry up with season 2 HBO."
"The first episode is perfection. The pacing is top notch- characters and their flaws are introduced naturally, nothing seems forced . The shot after the intro with the scenic music in the background just screams welcome back to Westeros, it's been a long time. New and old fans will enjoy it- although it definitely is helpful to know who Aegon the conqueror was and what he did- his name drops on several occasions but the average viewer won't figure out what he really did (the only criticism I really have) let's wait for the rest!"
"When I first heard I bought his new series I was very excited. After all you had one amazing two seasons of Game of Thrones. However, I am very disappointed with the shell it sounds to me like they're trying to extend something in order to make it longer than it should be. I would've preferred they did a six episode limited. Then drag on some of the most boring dialogue I've ever heard at times it is difficult to watch. I keep watching but only because of his predecessors, but things have to get better I'll just shut this thing down it's getting extremely annoying maybe what they should do is do what they did in the first series kill all the main actors And they start all over or just put more sex into it maybe they'll make the show better either way I hope it gets better. Last thing I have no idea who so-called people say that this show is phenomenal one of the best I've ever seen keeps you guessing and all that crap they must have gotten our a lot of money."
"I don't know what they are doing but this isn't game of thrones world. They can slap the label on it, use the name Targaryen 50000 times, but the feel, the language, the way of speaking, , the clothes, the buildings, the culture, it's all different. Not just different, more modern. They are saying the f-word for crying out loud! Oh and the king has a king's council that doesn't seem to have a SINGLE person from the seven houses. Let me tell you, that will NEVER EVER EVERRRRR happen.If that's not bad enough, it's just totally boring and predictable. Corlys Velaryon told his story, which was supposed to illicit some kind of emotions and attachment to the character but I just sat there and thought ""oh wow! The most boring character story ever! Thanks GoT producers."""
"I have watched most of this and enjoyed it, but the lighting keeps getting darker. I imagine it is a purposeful choice by the producers who are probably high on Art-house and the smell of their own farts, but by episode 7 the show is simply unwatchable. It is just black shapes moving around on a black background. I cannot see anything that is happening, and by episode 8, at the rate this is going, it will be an audio book.I really wish that Hollywood would pull their heads out of their self-aggrandizing behinds and make shows for their audiences instead of for themselves and their own sense of artistic arrogance."
"Why do people rate this so high?It's not nearly as good as GoT, which people love to compare it with.First season is boring, the action is happening only in 1 place... characters are predictable and the costumes are ridiculous.So why do people rate it so high? Is it political? Is it because of HBO or is it because of being a Warner Bros production?To me it seems purely a political score, not an artistic one.Long soap operas focused on the tragical faith of being a women who must carry children for the throne. (This was also one of the main storylines in GoT but do you know what else GoT had? Well, it had at least other 5 or 6 compelling storylines to follow.)I am trying to watch this with my girlfriend without feeling the need to leave a review but here we are now.We don't get the hype around this trash."
"I've been waiting for this show since the last episode of game of thrones ends, and now they're here to entertain us with blood and fire from the very first moment. A strong and slow start to take us deep inside the Targerians realm . The music upgrade is wonderful no need to change a lot since you scored high in the first show. The acting abilities are promising with the new faces on screen we watched. Waiting for more..."
"With GoT created expectation, the house of dragon opened up well. As usual there are scenes with Nudity, Violence and unimaginable making. The character got introduced very well, within the first episode each character got an arc and as an audience we also started thinking how it will play in future. Since it's running behind 200 years of GoT, I find myself connecting to any references other than the family names."
"The first episode of house of the dragon did really well. It really took me back to the same environment and feeling like in the Got series.Every character is very well made and you could feel the power and authority they send out.As I am a huge fan of Got, there is a + when the episode and characters refers to events and details in Got.In some scenes the same music from Got are in the background whick makes you more engaged."
Of two a very good start great build up episode for the chaos that is to come towards the end of the season. So glad that this has stuck to the feel of asoiaf and so far stuck to fire and blood!
House of the Dragon picks up the strengths that Game of Thrones was known and adored for:
"Complex and ambiguous main characters, whose development could turn either way any moment, well-designed costumes and a thrilling story.Even after only two episodes it becomes clear that the main characters of Viserys, Daemon and Rhaemyra are presented in a multi-layered way, so that there is no simple ""good or evil"".From this point in I hope that the pacing will not be rushed, leading to implausible character developments.After the first two episodes I am really looking forward to the next ones and don't get where the negative criticism comes from."
"I was skeptical as we all were after the final season of GoT, and even some of the castings I wasn't sure of. After the first two episodes I am blown away and excited again like Sunday nights back in mid season 5. I even like the opening using our familiar and beloved GoT theme, though I'm not totally sure yet what all we're being shown and look forward to how it develops over the next episodes.As a fan of the books, I'm happy to see how the show runners are once again closely following G. R. R. M.'s story and again only changing or enhancing it in the best ways. Luckily this story has been told pretty much in its entirety so there's no danger of the writers flailing around blind as so obviously happened in the final 2 seasons of Thrones. I love that they're adding in throwbacks to the story we've already read/seen (like King Viserys telling Rhaenyra about the prophecy of the Night King & Army of the Dead in their mission to bring on The Long Night).Every casting has proved fantastic for their character & they're each holding true to their source characters as well as truly fleshing them out in a way that builds investment in their stories. I particularly love the casting for Viserys, both Rhaenyras, both Alicents, the Sea Snake, Daemon, and Otto Hightower. I didn't think the end of the first episode was too graphic or at all off-putting and think it was told/filmed in a way that brought powerful emotion to the story so early on, which makes me excited to see what they'll do next. Knowing the story (but not wanting to spoil) I'll also say I'm pleased with the interactions between characters we know have a romantic future and think they tell and act it very well in consideration for any obvious age differences.I read the ASOIAF series so many times I literally think I could retell it all by heart, word for word, and liked it more than Fire and Blood. I was slightly less excited for HotD because of this, especially after the rushed nonsensical ending of a series that was so beloved and impeccable (before it ran out of source material). After just these first two episodes I'm completely confident that House of the Dragon will be just as good as Thrones was when at the top of its game. I'm re-reading Fire & Blood with a renewed interest and feel like it is such a gift that in a couple years we could be watching not just this one, but also the Jon Snow spinoff, and Game of Thrones will be redeemed.Update: I've now watched through episode 5. My mother and I have both read all the Westeros-based books, and I watch HotD when it airs Sunday night with my husband, then I download it and take it to my mom's to watch again on Wednesday nights because she lives in such a rural place she doesn't have internet access & adding hbo to her dishnetwork would be stupid since she'd only have access to the east & west live stream, and I pay for Hbo max.House of the Dragon is so good I'm just as excited to watch episodes the second time around as I am the first. In fact, I've been able to help explain things I missed to my mother who only gets to see it once. The main thing I missed, however, I had to read an article about: apparently Alicent was ""in love"" with Criston Cole and Rhaenyra has known this since the tourney he first appeared in, so her learning Rhaenyra had slept with him was what made her feel so betrayed. They could have fleshed that out a little better in the show, because otherwise it seems Alicent is just kinda jealous that Rhaenyra is getting some action while she has to sleep with the older king (Paddy Considine is quite attractive but they make King Viserys seem at least a decade older than Paddy and they cover him with leprosy sores- on that note, why don't they tell us he has Leprosy?? That's another thing I had to read- I had thought it was greyscale. Both are quite contagious though so why doesn't he spread it?!"")"
"Anyway this is getting long. The minor frustrations and misunderstandings are not near enough to make me drop any stars. This show is FANTASTIC. The actors are PHENOMENAL. We watch the LotR prequal as well and the two shouldn't be compared. I prefer HotD because it seems more for adults. The fantasy element is much less obvious compared to the drama/thriller/political aspects. This show is not getting an easy ride just because it's connected to GoT. I would be just as ecstatic about this show if GoT didn't exist. However, just as with Thrones, if you're not a book reader, you will need to watch the first few episodes to become invested in the characters and really give the story a chance.I am sorry to see Alcock & Carry leaving after episode 5 due to the 10 year time jump, but I love Emma D'arcy and Olivia Cooke and already know they'll be great in the older roles. There's no doubt this will be the catalyst of a fantastic career for Alcock and Carey, as well as any other younger or lesser known actors. They're all well cast and all impeccable in their roles.Period."
"Did these events really occurred 200 years before The Game Of Thrones????Sole purpose of inventing and using High Valyrian language is to make the viewers believe that the events in the series belonged to an era 200 years before The Game Of Thrones.But the team has seriously spoiled the realistic approach by allowing characters to wear some highly fashionable costumes, even weapons (not shown much), cutlery ietc. And the sets look more or the same as in The Games Of Thrones.I hope they will improve this later or it is too late??Two episodes and I am still waiting for the some interesting story or script."
"House of the Dragon tells a straightforward, well-written story in a medieval setting. It is more simple and less exciting than Game of Thrones, focusing on a smaller scale of locations, characters, and events. It doesn't have as many fantasy elements as Game of Thrones. However, House of the Dragon is a polished production - it looks good and everything makes sense. It isn't anything mind-blowing that would grip the average viewer, but it should engage fans of medieval drama, historical fiction, and fantasy. Watch it if you want to see more stuff like Game of Thrones.Enjoyment: 4.75/5. Critique: 4.25/5. Total: 9/10."
"Compared to the predecessor show, House of the Dragon is a very narrow story. I don't know that it would be my favorite subplot in an epic and grand GOT-like show, but it wouldn't be my least favorite either. It's a fairly interesting palace intrigue tale and handsomely set up."
"The biggest problem this show has is its pointlessness. It's just a prequel of an unfinished story, and a bad prequel at that.George RR Martin is a fantastic world builder but writing books/shows is a bit more than just building its wolds and characters. This show feels and ultimately is just a history lesson on Targaryens. And that wouldn't be a bad thing if we had an actual ending to the original books. But on its own, the show is really lacking of anything interesting.The characters are king, woman, woman, black guy, fat guy etc. And if you don't see a problem with Velaryons being black, when Aegon(I) mother was lady Valaena of that same house Velaryon, then you don't see a problem with inconsistent writing. If you don't have a problem with inconsistent writing, then anything can be a good show to you, which is debatable to put it mildly. And if a character's color isn't ""that important"", then why change it in the first place? Other then shoving wokeism down our throats?If you really want to get to know houses and the world more just go read The World of Ice & Fire. It's far more coherent and, even tho it's just a history compendium, far more interesting than this show."
"Absolutely brilliant so far. I do really like where they are going with this and each episode in my opinion is better than the last.The development of the characters keeps you engaged and the theme and the plot is done well and feels natural and not rushed. Although the pacing is slow, I'm enjoying the ride. I find myself impatiently waiting on the new episodes right after I watch the most recent one, I wish I had waited for it all to be released to binge. This is 100% a binge worthy series.The acting is spot on, all actors portray their characters to the T, I don't think there is anyone letting the side down.The direction is brilliant. Ok the special effects are not on par with the rings of power, but my god does this trump that show in every other way.Very exciting series so far, lets hope they can keep it up."
"Very good, wonderful, more than excellent work. I was amazed from the beginning of this cinematic masterpiece, but because (Game of Thrones) is more creative, but a good impression from the first for the quality of the cinematic work. I hope that the next episodes will be more interesting and tense for events."
"The events in this first episode are gripping and visceral. I know how this story unfolds, and this pilot has created so much anticipation and intrigue for me. Very well done introducing brand new characters in a world that is so established by its predecessor. A great first episode."
It was perfect

J.r martin thanks.I WATCHED this episode and i liked that
I wait for episode 2 ....
I love it
Matt Smith is so cool you know when i watching matt i think oh hey it's so cool
I love this show.
"The opening episode of House of the Dragon (Sky Atlantic) is simply spectacular. For an hour, it rattles through everything that made its predecessor, Game of Thrones, such a titan of the small screen, especially when it was in its prime. It is a greatest hits playlist of Westeros at its meatiest. Family members make promises they cannot keep as they connive and betray each other, in secret and in plain sight. There is jousting, romping and fighting. There are dragons, of course. There is a drunken orgy, an axe to the face, a caesarean without anaesthetic, seeping wounds, severed limbs and severed organs, too. George RR Martin's world struts its way back on to our screens with utter confidence and brio."
First episode of HOTD is better than first episode of GOT. I'm hyped to see the entire season. Daemon Targaryen character looks promising for me. Fszdgdfxhxdfhdsfgserg.
"The first few episodes didn't strike me as being anything all that special. Whereas the very first episode of Game of Thrones pulled you in immediately with conspiracy and scandalous lies, this series did not hook me until the pig with the wings.All of the characters are well-developed and interesting! My favorite is probably Daemond. I got some Jaime Lannister vibes from him, and Jaime was my favorite character in Game of Thrones. But I really like Aemond, too. I was able to relate to him because I was bullied by my own family members and I wanted to find a way to best them.Every single one of the actors, including the children, is fantastic in their role! Paddy Considine steals the show!The dialogue is very well-written.The sets are immaculate.The costumes are very fitting and some are even very creative.The effects, both digital and practical, are very impressive.The violence is satisfyingly gruesome.The music is great.There are some nice quiet moments where you understand everything without any dialogue.Aside from most of the episodes feeling unspecial and even boring to me at times, the time-skips were jarring, and sometimes the pacing felt too slow.I'll definitely stay tuned for the next four seasons. And I hope at some point they do something like the Red Wedding."
"Everything from the script, acting, visuals, and story is just as good as game of thrones original four runs.However there is a constant hypocrisy in many reviews of this show stating how they dislike the show for seemingly random and mostly inconsequential reason such as bad wigs being responsible for a 3/10 rating . A more commonly stated argument being that they liked game of thrones but didn't like house of the dragon because the show was slow and ""boring"". Anyone who has made this point obviously was one of the people who liked only the action (or just didn't really watch most) of game of thrones, as the parts of the show widely considered the best/most iconic were the slower, more dialogue, and character focused first four seasons.The whole goal of this new show is to capture the original feel of the GOT series and the ASOIF books that was acclaimed for it's subversion, realism, dark tone, deep politics, well placed and consequential action, and twisting storytelling. House of the dragon captures all of these elements almost perfectly and does some elements even better than the prior works."
"Having viewed five episodes of this 11 episode series, I am a rather disappointed audience member, if not a little bored. However, it would be mistaken to imply this new outing of Game of Throne is boring, overall, but sadly there is something across the storyline and premise which are nowhere near as compelling as the original. I feel this is true of numerous characters, plotlines and premise. They just do not deliver. Essentially, this storyline revolves around the politics of succession to the throne. Unsurprisingly, then, the story remains rooted in politics and political subtleties, intrigues, which do not transalte that well on screen. The cinematogrphy, casting and acting are strong, overall, but the premise and writing, possibly the directors and producers, also, seem to look to realise a vision which remains orphaned from the original's gripping excitement and interpersonal drama.Further, I am surprised at the constantly highly regarded ratings assigned to numerous episodes which, to me are necessarily worthy of such recognition. I will not say more here, but the phrase ratings manipulation does come to mind. I can only hope the remaining episodes do produce content worthy of high ratings."
"If this serie had a different name, it would score below average.I watched it till the 6th episode. One of the most boring series i have ever seen. Reason i watched it this far is because i had some hopes of things turning the tide, but no.This whole serie is focused on family drama and LGBT. Don't have too much hopes, even if you do, try watching the first and second episode, you'll understand what i mean.Totally nothing to do with Game of Thrones. The plot, the story, nothing gave me the interest to keep on watching. The sixth episode is my last, it's a total failure. Thanks for reading."
Yes read the 10 & 9 star reviews are indeed telling you the truth. This show is so good I don't even know what to say just every little thing that the creators and show runners put into the show. Have fallen so perfectly into place that it's almost supernatural I don't even like the original l GOT but this this is quality tv (even though it's not suitable for families to watch together) This is a really strong start for the show and if the whole season is as good as the first episode I'll be obsessed hell I'm already obsessed with it. This is a huge win for HBO because let's be honest this is the only good show on HBO (but what about euphoria) don't make me laugh I said what I said ðŸ˜­ back to this show I'm definitely gimme waiting to watch to this every weekend on time because on that First Sunday night 10million people were watching it and the app crashed I had to wait like 30 mins to get back into the app to watch it stop watching it guys so I can ðŸ˜­ maybe I should give this a 1 now that I think about it I'm joking of course but this show is that good.
What I mostly like about what I've seen so far is that the show brings us back to the simple things which we loved about Game of Thrones. Of course there is a giant budget and will eventually lead to bigger battle scenes but early on It peels back all the supernatural element from the later seasons of Game of Thrones and gives us the political in working and scheming that made Game of Thrones so interesting. The show very much has an early season Game of Thrones vibe to it so far. Also starting the episode with the Game of Thrones theme song was pretty awesome and very unexpected. I was a bit sceptical about the show but so far is had a very solid start. Being someone who has already read the fire and blood novel I can say that the show has been very faithful to the source material so far. If they stick to the story the show can be one of the all time greats.
"I feel they did extremely well with this. I understand they didn't have time to explain the true history of Rhaenyra and her father, but they got it done and it works. Great character and storyline introduction; the special effects we've come to revere. It was amazing. I had low expectations and honestly it feels good to be excited about a GoT show again!"
"""House of the Dragon"" Season 1 has swept me away into the intricate and captivating world of Westeros once again. As a devoted fan of George R. R. Martin's books, I approached this adaptation with both excitement and trepidation. However, I am thrilled to report that the series not only lives up to its source material but surpasses expectations.The casting choices in ""House of the Dragon"" are nothing short of excellent. Milly Alcock, Rhys Ifans, and particularly Matt Smith deliver outstanding performances that breathe life into their respective characters. Each actor brings a unique depth and complexity, embodying the essence of their roles with remarkable skill.While the series shines in many aspects, there were a few disappointing choices, particularly concerning the Velaryon family. Some characters felt underdeveloped, and the enigmatic Crabfeeder deserved more screen time to fully explore his potential. Nonetheless, these minor flaws do not overshadow the overall brilliance of the show.""House of the Dragon"" Season 1 is an absolute triumph, showcasing breathtaking visuals, intricate storytelling, and unforgettable characters. The rich tapestry of political intrigue and familial dynamics is masterfully woven together, drawing viewers into a world of dragons, power struggles, and moral complexities.As the credits rolled on the final episode, I found myself eagerly anticipating the arrival of Season 2. ""House of the Dragon"" has undoubtedly proven itself to be an absolute hit, and I cannot wait to delve further into the twists and turns of this captivating saga."
"Wow wow WOW! HBO's production values and GRRM's bring House of the Dragon to a roaring start. This show is a mix of spectacle, grandness, and nostalgia for GOT S1-4. Hope that the writing continues being sensible and high quality as the show goes on.9/10 - strong start!"
"I'd give a 7.5 but you can't, it has potential to be a good series. Saying 10/10 and could be better than game of thrones is just ridiculous, the first episode isn't as good as GOT, think it's easy to forget with GOT's bad ending. Overall though I was pleased with the connections to GOT and the direction the show seems to be going in. Worth the pilot episode."
"House of the Dragon has a lot of what I loved about Game of Thrones, but doesn't quite live up to it's predecessor. The first half of season 1 devotes a lot of (possibly too much) time setting up tensions between characters that aren't very convincing. By episode 5, I found myself asking ""why do these two people hate each other again?"""
"The second half of the show feels like a different series entirely, and is far superior to the first half. Tensions in the second half feel authentic, and the characters' actions deliver the familiar gut punch I felt watching Game of Thrones. At times, the characters' actions do not make a lot of sense, but this doesn't detract from the show in any major way.Fortunately, the show doesn't desensitize the viewers with too many dragon scenes, which was my primary concern. Scenes that include dragons feel necessary and appropriate, and I found myself excited to see them every time they were on screen."
"I am a huge GoT fan. I loved the series and have watched it over and over. Each time I do I pick up on more things. I will say I have never read the books since I have a reading comprehensive problem so my experience is what was presented in the show.That being said I have been waiting quite a whole for House of the Dragon to come on. The first moment it was available I watched it. I loved it. I dare say I loved it.more than I did the first episode of Game of Thrones. Mainly because I could understand it. I spent many of episodes trying to sort put who the characters were in GOT and how they all come together. HOTD seem to present more easily.I am excited about the dragons, I am excited about the show and I hope it continues. Of course they feel like they have to have these sex scenes to get adults to remain interested. I can do without but I take it all as it is presented.Yes the United Stayes are casting actors not because of their acting abilities but because of their race. Whatever, they chose their characters and I am not going to slam them with all the horrible acting choices everyone has made just to stay away from a white male hero stigmatized. Remember in GOT the targarans (spelling is probably wrong but you get the jest) were known for marrying their family members. I think that the producers probably forgot. I still loved the story and I still loved the feel of it. I am anxiously awaiting the 2nd episode and anymore shows that involve the grass roots of the families we lived or hated in GOT. Love the back stories.That's my opinion and I hope they continue in the GOT fashion and shock the hell put of the viewers. Let's face it when they ended GOT they got.more attention then they did the entire series. Looking forward to this story unfolding.."
"The show has a natural gravitas to it, owing to its realist premise and the types of grim dark fantasy you can get away with on HBO.Beyond that, though, the show is not really capturing the political or character intricacies that drew me to the original, and I find some of the direction and production lacklustre. We follow a smaller cast of characters, and for all its subtle references to the goings on of Westeros, the looming threats of the outside world feel much smaller in the context of our more narrow purview.I am glad to see it each week, and there are moments of dynamic depth between certain characters, but I'm not sure it has more to offer thematically than the twists and turns of its legendarium."
"Lack of action.Modern language used in those times, like ""decency"" .Pomegranate, cherries and papaya ??!! Are you nuts ?Wooden sofa and cushions and soft tapestry on chairs......"
"I thought they lived 200 years before Game of Thrones.....I believe that producers think that we, the viewers, are stupid and we do not have the capacity to see all the bad/wrong details in the show. It is not ALL about flying dragons, it is about the characters that suppose to keep us interested to see what is next. Unfortunately the actors are acting so bad, no expressions on their faces, like they are statues. There is no feeling there, no interesting ""stuff"" about them to be discovered.In Game of Thrones we saw many many many talented actors, some of them for the first time, that kept us interested about their character's stories and destiny, humanity, bravery. It was a pleasure to see how those talented actors showed us feelings and emotions and gave us a complete image about their character in the show.In House of Dragons it is only about talk talk talk, no substance, big cold castles were they were eating a lot of cooked food and having plenty of children. Sometimes they fly on dragons.A bad, bad show."
"Excellent start to the series. It's been a long 3 years since the end of Game of Thrones. Excited for this new season that takes place 172 years before the start of Game of Thrones. The first episode is at precise timing. It didn't drag on (no pun intended), but it was perfectly executed. Great acting all around by all cast. The actors selected are great, of course. Matt a smith is perfect at Deamon and Patty an weak but honorable king Targaryen. The first episode is very Well-written, concise, and entertaining. Excited to be back in the realm of Game of Thrones."
"I've been looking forward to House Of The Dragon ever since the first spy photos of Matt Smith and Emma D'Arcy were leaked on Reddit. I know the history of the Dance of Dragons, so my expectations were sky high, and the premiere alone went above and beyond. Matt Smith is Daemon Targaryen incarnate, Paddy Considine shines as Viserys in all of his scenes, Milly Alcock is a beautiful young Realm's Delight, and Sian Brooke stands out as Queen Aemma even in the short time she is in the first episode, especially her performance during the birth of Baelon. The small details that bring even more depth to the characters (such as Alicent's biting her nails in anxiety and Viserys working on a massive handmade model of Old Valyria) make them even more believable.The visuals are on par with the later seasons of Game Of Thrones while the writing goes back to the golden era of season one. A few juicy Small Council scenes have you on the edge of your seat, and the tourney is just beautiful. Seeing King's Landing at the height of Targaryen power with dragons ruling the skies just brings it all home."
"I never read the books, and since i loved game of thrones, wanted this series to be just great right from the word go. After 9 episodes it has started to reach the levels of ""good"" not great. It is not Game of Thrones, if you are comparing, but it is no Rings of Power either (wink wink )The first few episodes were a torture for me, things moving so fast, people getting older so fast ( except Criston Cole, who seems to have found the fountain of youth ) and things happening in a rush and indeed it seemed like the creators just wanted to get over the background before moving on to more drama and politics. But eventually things get better after 5-6 episodes when things actually happen and make sense. So drama wise it is getting better but as far as action is concerned, it still lacks any punch. Dragons are just for show off, they come, scream with spit flying around, burn here and there and and then go back to sleep somewhere. Though the story is moving towards the power struggles, there is no out and out bad guy that causes a shadow and impending showdown.So unless there is a night king or something popping in somewhere, it will stay a family drama ( yeah not much se* either here) instead of a thriller. Keeping my fingers crossed for this.( My rating is also influenced by the cra* that we are getting on all channels now, at least this is something i can watch without completely cringing)"
"Definitely Hits the same beat as season one. But with what's coming, it will be a great story equal to the war of the roses. And this will outshine woke of the rings, Strong female leads done right."
"So, after watching the episode for a second time I decided to come here to write a review. Where to start; as a book reader I can see the book coming into life. The episode has a lot, yet it takes time so nobody would get confused. George R. R Martin likes good dialogue, of course we do get some action, but that is just a compliment. The women from the series specially Rhaenyra's mother oh my gosh...The characters are so interesting. No good vs evil, or black vs white ( for the love of George this show is not woke, and Corlys Veralyon is amazing). No annoying Lyanna Mormont telling grown man to shut up. No silly dialogue "" I don't want it"", but enough with the past. House of the Dragon is the future, and the future promise us hot sex scenes, sweet daddy daemon showing who is in command, amazing Rhaenyra, amazing Rhaenys, amazing Alicent, annoying Otto, confused Viserys, anyway for the love of the old and new gods give this show a chance. I just cannot wait for the next episode."
"To be honest i would be more appreciated if we could see emilia clarke in the series. Alicent is such an as.h.ole.as far as i know they will show us in becoming seasons not the things we would wanna see but i am excited about the what will happen in the future. Although the first season is good,we canÂ´Â´t compare it with GOT. The characters really represents the whole story really good. Especially the last two episodes. You can have goosebumps in some scenes,i can assure you that. But this feeling is like i said not in every scene and you can't keep up with that. GOT was really whole another level of enternainment ,feelings and scenes.Hopefully we would see more exciting scenes in next seasons and watch it as whole like GoT."
"'House of the Dragon', the prologue series to 'Game of Thrones', chronicles the Targaryen empire at the height of its rule, and the internal power struggles within. Beginning 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen, King Viserys I (Paddy Considine) sits on the Iron Throne and his daughter, Rhaenyra Targaryen (Milly Alcock, then recast to Emma D'Arcy) is named successor - a massive blow to the generations-long tradition of naming male heirs. Prince Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith), Lord Corlys Verarion (Steve Toussaint), Alicent Hightower (Emily Carey, then recast to Olivia Cooke) all play vital and pivotal roles in the next Lord of the Realm.Excellently filmed and acted! The feel is very similar to the early seasons of Game of Thrones - set pieces, narration, flow, and overall feel. The major setback is the time jumps between episodes. Everything in the first few episodes skips years in advance and may leave some viewers having trouble building relatability with the characters. The other drawback from the flagship series is the overall lack of nudity some may be expecting; and due to some of the negativity surrounding nude scenes in GoT, its no wonder the lack of skin is evident.Worth a watch!"
"This work is wonderful, and even in relation to me, it is the best Ola series ever, and it surpasses Ola Game of Thrones. With all my regards, we hope that Ola completes this wonderful path. Also, I have a note that Damon Targaryen is the best character in the world of cinema. I never expected a character of this beauty to come. Damon is a gray character and Cruel and slightly inclined to evil. It is a beautiful thing to combine this mixture and make it into one character, and dragons. Dragons look great, with the exception of some scenes. They should work more on CGI. Many thanks to everyone who contributed to this wonderful work."
"This one actually starts better than Game of thrones.Fantasy wise it is not as magical , cause Game of thrones had that mystery all around.. But this one has more dragons and it's faster... And don't get me started with Daemon & Rhaenera! The chemistry! DAEMON DAEMON DAEMON! This guy literally owns this show. Matt Smith was absolutely perfect choice for this character. He is the bad guy we all love! I am sad they're changing actress for Rhaenera. I liked this young lady and she was bad ass! They should have kept her. But Maybe I fall for the new one as well! (Please let it be so). Anyway, effects are a bit weaker than in Game of thrones. That was probably the highest level of effects ever on fantasy series. But it is very interesting. I am looking forward to see more! So far it's an 8 from me! ðŸ˜Š"
"This is not GOT. There's nothing even comparable to GOT. In GOT you had interesting characters and a good plot. This is apparently directed towards an audience that likes court drama and royalty scheming against each other. There's no relatable characters, it's just some version of an English royalty family and their in-breeding and scheming when they obviously have too much time in their hands and nothing real to do. I'm sure the people would be much better off without a completely useless Targaryen family and their stupid drama. I mean, what's even the main plot line? The princess is going to be queen but doesn't want to be married? Come on."
"Whilst not as good as the first episode of GOT, I really enjoyed this episode. The cast did a decent job, especially Matt Smith! The story was engaging. I found the references to the White Walkers a bit silly, but I am very much looking forward to the rest of the series."
"This show is perfect, cinematography is beautiful actors were a good choice and showing us the strong blood and connection to Targaryen and Velaryon house is amazing,Rhaenyra is amazing main character with some great moments Alicent relationship with Rhae is pretty good and the change of her relationship is amazing.the character are amazing written. This show is showing Targaryens civil war very accurate to books and Relationship between Rhae and Alicent children is amazing they hate each other and would take another eye for fun the story is amazing and references from last episodes to the first are amazing i love it."
It was perfect everything is good with you all and then have to get back.fighting in a fight for the last few weeks I am not going through a new one and I'm going back and I am going for the rest and all of us to do it for my kids to be able and all to have done for the next couple days if they want to do that as soon I'm sure they will be doing a better thing to help us out with a new team to help us with this new job as a new way.
"The episode was chock full of action , although quite gruesome and depressing for the most part, it held my attention and hooked me from the start. The actors are top notch and the dragons believable too. Can hardly wait until E2 next week! Wish I could binge watch!"
"The spin-off recaptures the power, grandeur of the original."" She also stated that, ""This fresh chapter in the saga of the Seven Kingdoms is reverse-engineered to feed into narratives and family trees that are familiar to GoT devotees."" Ali, in one of her tweets wrote ""So far, 'House of the Dragon' appears to be a worthy heir to Game of Thrones."" She also pointed out, ""t's best to brace now for the genealogy chatter around Houses Targaryen, Lannister, Velaryon and Hightower, for theories connecting the future with the past and for ghoulish discussions of which series featured more graphic displays of blood, gore and guts."" Finally, they delivered once again a quality product, matt smith (daemon) aura is like a dragons salvo, A mad price execute the entire HOTD realm at last. Every character will set a benchmark at last. We want a bigger climax than GOT. And a request to the creator of this epic show ,please don't spoil our emotion that we faced in GOT last season. Give a full opportunity to the lead actor, because still we feel sad for john snow."
"At first I thought this would be a woke show, not gonna lie. I still remember Arya character from las season of game of thrones. A small girl who became the best assassin in the world and could disguise herself as anybody, she who turn the tables on the war against the dead when John Snow was powerless against a dead dragon. I predicted the new princess would be just like Arya, perfect in every way, but to this day she hasn't been so great. Don't get ne wrong, I'm not saying this show won't be woke in some moment in the future (it might) but so far I am very pleased with this script that reminds me of George R. R. Martin in the first Game of Thrones seasons with all the politics and conflicts."
"Ok, so this episode is good, but not great.There were 3 highlight scenes in this one.First, the funeral. I already miss Daemons wife. I don't why I loved her so much. But the emotion in this scene although hysterical to Daemon is heavy. I really feel for the Valyrions in this ep. Great scene with great music.Next, the wake. This scene gave us an update on how each character interacts after the 10 year jump. This was the perfect building of of tension to let loose in the final scene.The final scene was perfect and showed us how far both the heir to the iron throne and alicents hate goes and the willingness to go as far as to damage each other's children.EP 7: 7/10I prefer episode 6 to this one."
Feels like watching GoT again. The quality is good and the characters are promising. Music is fantastic. I just hope it'll be unpredictable as GoT was.
"I loved GoT Season 1 to 6. I was a huge fan of the Night King character and felt they did that character zero justice. There is your context for why I rated this 6/10. I expected it to be better than it was. This was too obvious, whereas GoT was not (initially). The pacing wasn't great either - huge leaps in time and frankly I couldn't get invested in any of the characters. Don't watch this if you're looking for a gem of a character like GoT spoilt us with (take your pick, there were many really interesting characters). Worth a watch, but it isn't as good as it could have been.On the positive side, it is again a beautiful world and setup. The dragons were cool but even that was a bit too obviously CGI (in other words, attention to detail was lacking). The music was probably the best bit of this as it was very much in the correct theme of GoT. Lastly, some of the acting is great, so props to the cast."
"House of dragon is a disaster. It was awful since episode one and got even worse after a ridiculous time-jump recasting in episode six. I admire game of thrones. Story was very interesting. HOD is nothing like that. It's more like a Turkish love story with complicated affections than an thrilling drama. You don't get an understanding of personality and motivations of casts, as if they are lost in the story, as are their audience. It's pitty how producers abused the fame from GOT and waste a lot of money on a boring production. I wish there was a way to stop them from producing more episodes of bs."
The first episode of the series is very good. In Game of thrones series the targrayen house did not explore but in this series we are see the depth of this house. The series started then me realised the vibe actually same the Game of thrones vibe. I am very happy to see the feel of the series vibe and the story is good I feel. The first episode set the track the series same like Game of thrones. In some scene CGI is too weak but the story and presentation style don't be unhappy you.
What a beautiful start of HOTD. BGM music with story slowly & gradually moving & writing dialogue screenplay just outstanding . Budget of this season seems high .
"It's like I'm watching Game of Thrones, but it's I would say, better. Acting is incredible and I can't wait to see all the fight, blood, etc. Coming to the show. Just a fantastic tv show I give him 10/10 and I hope they still make such an impressive episodes. Keep it up."
"It seems to me that this is on the path of the original GOT series! If they continue with the quality of the first episode, this could be another marathon series. I'm in!!"
Amazing As for the first episode of a new series on the scene and it is considered inspired by the original and this we see does not always work for you in the dragon house we will expect something eals.
"After this season concludes, we should just call it season 8 of GoT.Still kind of confused about all the family tree and the connection between GoT and HoTD family trees. So many named characters named :""Aegon.""I think I might be better of reading the books to get a better understanding of all the connections between the characters.But this show is really promising, and can't wait for more new episodes!Still rather perplexed by the entire family tree and the relationship between the HoTD and GoT family lineages. The name ""Aegon"" appears on so many characters.But I can't wait for more brand-new episodes of this program since it seems so promising!"
"I thought the acting was good, excellent cinematography but thought the plot was very predictable. Felt the animosity between the hand and the prince was a bit forced. The bad birth of the child extremely predictable and also the death of the boy. Hope for much more in the later episodes."
"It was everything I dreamed a Game of Thrones series would be and more. Definitely didn't disappoint. It was a story of politics, dark fantasy, and brutality. A masterful opening."
"I'm 6 episodes in and it's pretty good. It's not as good as the original series but let's be honest, not much is. The nerds will complain about absolutely everything of course but I have been enjoying it. There is only 1 plot line really unlike the original series which had several parallel lines that were destined to collide. So it is less sophisticated than the original in that sense. HoTD also skips forward in time basically every episode (so far at least) which is a little confusing at times but does advance you through lots of events at a good clip instead of spending a whole season on one point in time, which I think is a plus considering there is only the 1 plot for the most part. The 1 star reviews on here are comical, I don't see how you could give it less than a 5. Nothing is for everyone and HoTD certainly isn't perfect but if you loved the original series then there is plenty of things to like in this new one."
"Well, episode 7 has dropped, as they say now, but this dud insists on droning on aimlessly. I'm just bored. No likeable characters, which is surely a crime. No one to care about or root for. No charm or wit. Poor acting, low budget and dull script. The synopsis is convoluted and dragged out over far too many years. I'm still watching though, in the vague hope that maybe they will throw some running dead people in to liven it all up. Okay, I know. Surely, though, it is the duty of the writers to make this show as good, if not better, than the previous one? Not much worse. If it can't be improved, or equalled, perhaps it shouldn't have seen the light of day?"
"Best TV Serie of the Year 2022. Amazon should take note of how they make a great epic fantasy serie and amazing book adaptation for their embarrassing Rings of Power. A must see!!!. The characters are built with great depth, they are not good or bad, they all have their motivations that change over the years and situations. The plot is built very slowly and in a complex and very intelligent way. It is not a series of swords, dragons and action, but of intrigue, power struggles and hatred in a family that we see self-destruct. The changes of time and actors are very well carried out and together with the setting and art (IMPRESSIVE) they create a feeling of epic and grandeur of this fantasy world."
"Like any series, it takes time to build characters. Sure GoT introduced the world to Westeros and all, with amazing characters and an absolute garbage ending, but it took time to build.Give it at least two seasons before you start comparing it to GoT. It took at least four seasons for that series to gain true momentum with wider audiences. Can't expect a few episodes of a new story arc to bring in that much excitement.But, I'm looking forward to seeing more. You can slowly see the seeds and chess pieces shifting into place... it'll take time before the big moves are made. There'll plenty of new characters introduced over time. If these characters are 'boring' then be thankful they're seen now. Remember, only a few made it from S01E01 of GoT right to the end. Chances are it'll be the same here."
"I didn't expect it to be THAT good. They don't try to please anyone and just focus on the story. You will not regret watching this. The intrigue, the plot, the characters. Everything is well thought.After the last couple seasons of GoT, did not have high expectations for HotD. Several episodes into the first season of HotD, and it is doing great.I am really happy that this show has been true to the source material. No, it's not as good as GOT, which spent more time developing, but It keeps getting better!!!. I wait every sunday for a new episode. This and Rick and Morty makes my hbo subscription worth paying."
"I swear to God, if the novel is quoted to the letter, you will forget the game of thrones and its unfinished epic, but rather has become a disappointment for many lovers of the world of ice and fire, which has become like a dagger in the heart of every follower, like the dagger ""Jon Snow"" that treacherously implanted in the heart of ""Daenerys."" You will regain that joy and amazement when it is quoted. Such greatness as in the very wonderful novel by the great writer George R. R. Martin, and I hope so."
"A lot of people seem to be giving up on this show, as a book reader I find it funny because what they've shown so far is essentially the prologue and it was adapted perfectly. Perhaps if I didn't know what was being set up I wouldn't love it as much but once the dance starts unfolding all the setup and foreshadowing that's been beautifully done will makes sense. All the twists, scheming, battles that you expect from this IP will come and will be more impactful because of what we've seen in these episodes.To me the dance of dragons was a better written conflict than the war of five kings that the original series portrays. The main reason for that is all of this characterization that we are getting now. I love the original series but could you imagine watching the show, knowing how Cersei's teenage years shaped her into the political creature she was or how Tywin's upbringing and the faults of his father made him into the force he became? That's essentially what you're getting now so be grateful because the payoff will be so much sweeter because of it."
"This is absolutely incredible already. I can tell this is going to be just as good as game as thrones, which is so incredibly hard to beat. The characters, cinematography, the writing, etc, it has all lived up to its name. I've never been so hooked on a show so fast, and I watched game of thrones first!"
"Visually brilliant, strong characters and good story so far but not a GOT.Is a good phantasy / medieval story, however the strong point about GOT was the richness in different characters and multiple developments across the entire continent and houses.SO far we are seeing Targaryen's and almost exclusively Targaryen's (or their cousins...which are basically Targaryen's with a Sea Snake banner instead of a Drake).I must agree is a good flick to pass time...but not as great as S1 to S6 of GOT. Even the recent war incident of episode 3 sounded unrealistic and mundane.So basically the crab king was entrenched in his caverns for months and the only thing that they had to do was a double strategy of dragon taking care of the archers while the foot soldier stormed the beaches...why not perform the exactly that from the get go.Summary: There's margin for progression the series, let's see where it takes us, meanwhile let's enjoy the run :)"
"This show had to do a lot of heavy lifting since its a prequel to a series that ended in a complete disaster and is telling a story based off source material that I personally consider to be subpar because of how unreliable all of the sources telling this story are in the book. So to say that this show had the odds against them is putting it nicely.And yet...I'm actually impressed with what the writers were able to do here.This show is set 100 years after Aegon's conquest and about 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones takes place. The series takes place in essentially what is considered to be the ""golden years"" of House Targaryen. They are at the height of their power, the 7 kingdoms are prosperous, and unlike it's predecessor, dragons are a part of everyday life for the common folk since there are so many around. Right from the get go we are witnessing a succession crisis in Westeros in which King Jaehearys must decide which of his two grandchildren must he choose to be his heir since all of his children have passed before him. He leaves the matter to a vote amongst the high lords of Westeros. The contenders: Rheanys, who is the first born to the eldest son of Jaehearys or Viserys, who is the eldest male grandchild. The high lords choose to bypass Rheanys' claim on the basis of a patriarchal system and model that is so enshrined in Westerosi culture that stipulates that only men should rule. Viserys is named the heir to the throne and we see in the 13-14 year time jump, he had ascended the throne as King.We are introduced to Rheanyra, the only child of King Viserys I and his cousin-wife, Aemma Arryn riding atop her dragon Syrax above the skies of Kings Landing. We also meet some of the powerful people in Viserys' court. We are introduced to Corlys Valaryon. Husband to Rheanys and proclaimed Lord of the Tides who's seat is at Driftmark. We meet Otto Hightower. Hand of the King and he comes from one of the most powerful house since his family resides in the religious capital of Westeros, Oldtown. His teenage daughter, Alicent is lady-in-waiting to her best friend, Rheanyra whom she shares a close bond with. And then we meet our Rogue Prince and the younger brother of the king, Daemon Targaryen (Which in all honesty is my favorite character to come from this show. Matt Smith's charisma, charm, and candor really brings him to life) We meet Daemon as he sits upon the Iron Throne, which is in a COMPLETE different shape than how it looks in Game of Thrones. He's basking in all of the glory of being Viserys' heir since his marriage with Aemma hasn't produced a male heir.In a series of events (that is too much time to detail), Aemma tragically dies in childbirth leaving a blatant succession crisis for Viserys.. He has three choices to contend with: 1. Daemon, a highly contriversial figure yet the eldest male in-in line, 2. Rheanyra, his only trueborn daughter who would become the first Queen to sit on the Iron Throne and a decision many would scorn, or 3. Remarrying and hoping to produce a male heir that can succeed him. Hoping to satisfy the best of all worlds and after hurtful words are exchanged between him and Daemon (leading to him being removed from consideration as his heir), Viserys decided to name Rheanyra as his heir but also decided to marry Alicent Hightower, who has been a source of comfort to Viserys while he was grieving his losses.Now as with what we know about Westeros, nothing ever goes well and that's the exact predicament that is seen with Viserys choices. It causes scandal, scheming, tension, and division among his family, and it seems like no matter what he tries, nothing will ever work out fine.In the years since Rheanyra was named heir, cracks start forming in House Targaryen as loyalty is tested through scandalous trial and tribulations and sides are being formed to contend with growing changes.The series utilizes time jumps to emphasize change in time and attitudes. We see the character growing more mature as they try to navigate with the issues at hand.The acting is phenomenal. I truly believe amongst this cast, the standout have to be Paddy Constentine, Matt Smith, Emma D'Arcy, Olivia Cooke, Milly Alcock, Steve Toussaint, Eve Best, Leo Ashton and Rhys Ifans. Everyone brought their A-game, but all of these actors deserve every bit of praise possible. The chemistry is beautiful.The writing is a tossed coin. Most of these episodes are really well written but there are maybe 1 or 2 where the writing a dialogue feel weak. So I don't know if I should take that as a warning sign to jump off this train before disappointment, but I still have some faith. I'm really invested so far with this plot and these characters.The writing is *chefs kiss* once again by my man Ramin Djawdi. Give that man praise for every bit of the score and you can bet I'm never gonna shut up about how much praise and awards he deserves.The production value is completely off the charts compared to earlier season of Game of Thrones. CGI once again was hit or miss depending on your standpoint. Many of the shots are absolutely gorgeous but their are some CGI bits that do look wonky. But hats off the the production crew for their hardwork through filming during COVID. I can't wait to see what they bring next season!I think this show has potential. It was a surprisingly good start to a show that is coming from a really bad ending and it shocked me by actually making me invested in the plot and its characters. Now... am I willing to toot the horn on this show? Not yet because I'm still learning from my mistakes with Game of Thrones. I'll definitely tune in for next season, that's for sure!"
"Underwhelming.But since I loved GOT so much I will still give this a chance. I'm not crazy about the casting, the music saved it although it's basically just a rehash from GOT for the most part."
I've really tried with this as I wanted to like it SO much.I kept hoping it would improve....but now after Episode 6...all hope is lost.I fell in love with so many GOT characters - both heroes and villains - right from the get go.Season after season I was awestruck and blown away by the storyline and all else.That included Season 8....if you didn't see that coming - you weren't paying attention.The HOTD line up is so lame I'm barely interested in any of them.Like so many other reviewers have commented....its a soap opera.Daemon (Matt Smith) promised so much - yet has delivered so little.They and the whole of HOTD are a mere shadow of GOT.
"I was extremely skeptic due to how GoT declined through the end and the first episode didn't really do anything for me. The following 2 episodes sparked my interest though and I'm fairly sure I'll follow this show (unlike the rings of power). They've captured some of the original feel and their choice for Rhaenyra seems to be a really good one. She manages to show her feelings without letting down her guard too much (yeah, she still is the one chosen for succession.Though I initially thought the actor playing Daemon seemed too weak for the part perhaps he'll prove me wrong for perhaps his strength won't be the masculine strong appearance but rather the psychopathic ""do whatever it takes""-approach.Now I just hope that they'll keep it going up so it doesn't crash and burn..."
"It's dramatic, intentionally disgusting, it makes you think what's the limit (if there's one) of power and how far people go to have it"
"martin's my favorite autor 4life, and the showrunners are giving me the same amazing experience that i felt while reading fire & blood.And what to say about the cast? COMPLETELY impressive, in love with milly and emily, already missing them, but GOD emma and olivia are already killing in the show"
"the photograph is amazing as well, and you never get bored with the story"
"im the kind of guy who doesn't like seeing blood and assassinations all the time on tv programs because it's too shallow for a whole plot, and hotd can combine it with a very wonderful story of treasons and surprising twists. Love all of them.VISCERAL."
The show gives us those same thrills as Game of Thrones. Everything seems to be going by the book and I can wait to see what I've read come to life. It feels so good to be back in Westeros!!!
"LIVE LOVE LAUGH THIS SHOW. I mean I started it because umm it has DRAGONS. Nobody does dragons like the GOT universe! But I will say that i didn't expect to love this show this much!!! It's got everything and captivating world, likeable characters and amazing costume design. I even started reading the book because of how excited I got haha. I will say it did start off slow but it did pick up by the end and I know it's a built up of what's to COMEEE!! And I'm guessing that's these troll comments clearly have no idea what a built up even is. CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEW SEASON. Revenge, violence, and most importantly more dragons!! (with a sprinkle of incest)"
"Woooow wooow. It's a very wonderful episode and it took me a while to focus on the events and came out with the result that it's an episode that deservedly evaluated me 10/10, now? Wait until next Monday to see the greatness again."
"The problem is bad writing and bad acting.I do not mind to have great black / gay / women actors a long as they are great actors and take you there to the scene.They also need competent writers. It's easy when you have the great books of George RR Martin. Stick to the books, stray away from the politics and you will have a great show.I was / I am still a big fan of the original GoT. This is just garbage. Stay away."
"Seriously... This ""prequel"" is by far MUCH MORE amazing than ""Game of Thrones"" - which it was a... ""Dallas"" or ""Dynasty"" soap opera, with mediaval/fantasy elements!This here, starts with a blow on your face! Extremely powerful, with lot battles, with dragons, with knight dangerous games, with assassinations, from the very first episodes!In the ""Game of Thrones"", we had an amazing 1st Season and then, dull/boring seasons with endless talking, endless conversations and FEW moments of epic action. (To me, the ""GoT"" last 8-9 seasons and the ENTIRE action was... a couple episodes' length of minutes!)I really like this prequel, a lot! MUCH MUCH more than ""GoT""! The ONLY thing that ""GoT"" had better, are the actors. Yes, here in ""House of the Dragon"", there are also great actors - but let's be honest, in ""GoT"" the casting was SUPER amazing, much more than here.Otherwise, I SUPER enjoyed the first 5 episodes, I really looking forward for the rest ...and I hope for A LOT seasons to come!"
"I forgave the first episode for hammering the equal rights drum because it seemed like a decent start albeit a bit safe, but the second episode has continued to hammer that same equal rights drum and the scenes are all based around the same small cast in the same locations... There's no broad scope or grand scale feel to the show, it's very narrow.I'm really hoping they are just building up to something before broadening the show. Because there is no way this show will succeed with one plotline, 10 characters and probably around 6 different proper sets.l, especially when you consider that in GOT each episode probably covered 4 plotlines had a dozen or so big sets and included a cast of 20 or so main / secondary characters."
HOUSE OF DRAGONS
"HBO's long-awaited prequel series has the swords and the dragon flame, the Hand and the Iron Throne. This comes with the best visual effects, cinematography, cast, background score, and crew. Carrying the nostalgia of the great game of thrones with a theme song.A prequel to Game of Thrones, it begins 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen, and it chronicles the fall of the Targaryen dynasty. The storyline of the first episode is engaging. It feels like watching the game of thrones. We should thank HBO to rebound the prequel.The screenplay, cast, and crew, background art, music, and storytelling are so promising to watch. Family members make promises they cannot keep as they connive and betray each other, in secret and in plain sight. There is jousting, romping, and fighting each other."
"Update: What a disaster. They finally built it up to getting near GOT standards, we get somewhat attached to the characters etc and then they burnt it right to the ground all in one episode (6). They really are rushing the timeline, this is a writing failure, changing (some, which is laughable too) actors and actresses mid-season is just ridiculous wow, again some age a decade (more?) and others not a day lol. They could of had lots of action in the shows without rushing to future bigger events and resorting to these drastic measures good grief. There are some other writing failures in this episode too which I won't mention to avoid spoilers but suffice to say its one big flop (did they change writers too, crikey).So my rating for EP6 would be a big fat 2, sadly. You feel lost as you watch it because too much time passed, too many things changed and worse the same atmosphere is just not there with the new cast, not to mention just how jarring it is and it was SUPER boring to top it all off. EP5 would rate an 8 or 9 it was really great. Apparently it does get good again in EP 8&9 but to be honest I really feel let down by the writing and cast changes and am very tempted to just stop watching, what a cluster.---- Original review below -----So it is not up to GOT standards, mostly, and that shouldn't surprise anyone since that is one of the best (if not THE, my fav for sure) shows ever made. Acting, Directing, Writing etc are all decent to good; probably writing being the weaker link and production also some scenes are WAY too dark can't see anything at all. So there are little issues here and there for sure, not a single blond actor chosen for Targs LOL, worse they forced the racial card sticking blonde wigs on black folks, yes it looks as dumb as it sounds. They skip large amounts of time and some kids grow up, and the Princess doesn't age a year, etc things like this. You can let this stuff bother you, or you can let it go and enjoy the show.It starts off a little slow sure, but there is some intrigue there from the onset and some characters show, they are, ""characters"" indeed (Daemon in particular...). Every show draws you in a little more as the ""pot stir"" starts ramping up more and more, and you get some action in different ways in each episode as well. All fairly pedestrian though to today's standards, but then BAM! Things ramp WAY up in EP5 and you really get that GOT vibe again nice! So much stuff happens, remember EP 9 or 10 in GOT, yeah, it was just like that! Good stuff and glad I ignored the negative reviews.My rating before seeing EP 5 would be 7 or 7.5, but EP 5 was so good I give it a full 8, at least for now."
"Almost all of the elements that made GOT an artful paradigm without peer are missing here. Everything is just off enough to border on parody.It's not so much a storyline as an explanation. And in the end, who cares?Not a single character has any of the charisma that drew viewers to even the most minor character in GOT. Oh, there is one, but she's killed off halfway through the first episode.The costumes look tired, not ancient. The knights look like something out of a production of Don Quixote.The violence, cruelty, and sex? Either cringeworthy or fake. Certainly gratuitous, as if it's obligatory given audience expectations.Alas, I'm not even interested in seeing if episode II is any better given the grave false start.Update: no improvement after two episodes; if anything it went down a notch. Basically a boring medieval soap opera.In the end, very disappointing. I think the producers thought GOT was a Marvel franchise instead of what was arguably the pinnacle of small screen serial filmmaking with nearly perfect attention to detail."
"GoT is still my favorite show of all time, even considering the light drop in quality from season 7, and rushed season 8 (which on second view actually isn't that bad). So, a spin off. Didn't know what to expect. But I am pleasantly surprised. With perfect pacing, brilliantly acted characters and an intriguing story line, I was hooked from episode two. What a well written show. The dialogue is GoT at its best with all the forboding and innuendo in even the simplest conversations. Supposedly written by the shows writing staff, as the book are more descriptive with less dialogue. Episode 6 did confuse me a bit considering the massive time jump, and only select cast members being replaced for older versions, where the male characters are the same. Some older looking, like the king, while others look exactly the same. I suppose there is a reason for this, will have to see how the rest of the season unfolds."
"As a diehard GOT fan who has read all of the books, I was so excited for this series and I can proudly say that it does not disappoint! The foundations for each character have been laid well and I'm excited to see the progress as the season continues. I just finished the 3rd episode and I'm hooked. The final season of GOT was such a disappointment, so I'm hoping that HOTD can keep up with the hype. There is so much potential with this series and if they stick to the book, it's going to be absolutely amazing. If anyone is questioning whether to watch or not, I strongly recommend giving it a go. They've done a brilliant job so far. It has the blood, gore, drama, dragons and everything GOT fans could've wanted."
Stripped back the excess of the last 2 seasons of Game Thrones. Built the tension beautifully with strong character development. Contained all the politics (and incest) westeros is known for and I can only see the series getting better from here.The creaters have shown a lot of care honouring the lore and source material. The mood is consistently moody and intense. I have read a few complaints about the lighting but I feel this only enhances the atmosphere the show is trying to create.Now they have built a great foundation I am looking forward to perhaps seeing some more houses and characters introduced next season.
"Given a better budget than the earlier seasons of Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon perhaps gives us what it truly looks like to live in the world of Westeros. Better production values, magnificent building (castle) designs and extravagant costume choices(for the Nobles) than its predecessor.In terms of screenplay, the most outstanding parts are- the ones that most would rather contemplate to be boring- the political intrigues, especially between Daemon Targaryen and Otto Hightower. Rhaenyra Targaryen's narrative mostly is showed as a courageous coming of age story in a mostly internalized misogynistic world.There really is an illusion among the larger contemporary audience, that this show(HotD) is gifted with a fully completed source material than Game of thrones. For all those, I might want to remind you, that ""Fire and Blood"" is written like a history book by Archmaester Gyldayn inside ""the World of Westeros"" rather than a novel. Incidents that happen in that book are written with a help of second or third hand witnesses like court jesters, instead of straight POVs like in the main novels. So the incidents that are depicted in that book must be taken with a grain of salt. Also, arguably there is no reason to believe that this version of Archmaester Gyldayn's history is not riddled with conspiracy. The Archmaesters are from OldTown. The HighTowers are from OldTown. My point is that the book is conveniently lenient towards House Hightower(atleast most of the times).This is the foremost problem with ""Fire and Blood"". It is so precise and riddled with conspiracies. With roughly 700 pages it covers 135 years of Targaryen history. Of that history, this show might cover like 30 years of it. My point is that the previous show had so much potential with ""ASOIAF"" series containing over 3500 pages(5 books) only for a 4 year timeline.(297AC-301AC).This is the REAL challenge the showrunners Ryan and Miguel might come across in the future seasons. Looking at Miguel Sapochnik's previous work like ""Battle of the Bastards"", ""the Winds of Winter"" and ""Hardhome"" which are hailed as some of the best episodes in Game of thrones, they might actually succeed in forging an actual believable history in this ""Ice and Fire"" World."
"This is my kind of show, fantasy elements, incredible cgi and atmosphere, great characters, great acting, and it looks phenomenal.I love the intrigue, the fast pacing and the character scenes. They are all a joy to watch as the tensions build up towards the (inevitable at this point) civil strife.I do have some problems with the show however. Parts of the plot, violence and sex are a bit too much, or too extreme to be believed. There are some minor plot points that don't make any sense but could have been changed easily or could have been explained with a few extra bits of dialogue. Also the time jumps can be jarring for some people.Another problem one could have is the lack of likable or morally good characters, which isn't complete and I actually don't mind that much, but it would be an improvement for the show to see what a smart & powerful but also good & just character would do in the situations presented by the show.Objectively, overall, I think the show deserves an 8.5/10, I was tempted to give it a 9/10 but I feel like rounding down because the show could be a clear 9 with just a few improvements which weren't made."
GOT Started with great 6 seasons but had worst ending seasons. This series starting itself irritating and running the race with awful performances and direction. HBO and directors are in hurry to make sure audiences running away from TV or streaming screens. Each episode has long useless scenes with quick jump and without building the characters.The acting from the main characters are irritating with no sense. The graphics are ok but could have utilised more with latest technology. There are some lengthy awkward scenes which could have been avoided or should be part of the story without rush to enjoy it.

"I enjoy and appreciate how different this show is from the original GOT series. Even if people want and beg for more GOT, the writers tend to know best and we really do not want more of the exact same. House of the Dragon is largely focused on the tensions of family bloodlines, especially strained due to firstborn births of daughters in a male dominated middle age world. As a result, the plot is thick with dialogue around what I will broadly label as ""family drama."" Doesn't sound like GOT? Family drama + Dragons, so maybe a little more GOT now.The focus around family and births and children and romances that are and are not occurring turns this show into a bit of a highly produced soap opera at some points. The writing for this soap opera is great, and it has dragons and death so that's an added bonus, but as with most soap operas the drama can be dragged out just a bit too much.One thing I would like to call out separately is the sheer number of birth scenes in this show. I have never seen so many screaming, bloody births in one series of television in my entire life. Definitely could have cut the number of on screen births in half.Overall, I enjoyed the first season and look forward to the second. I hope the writers stay true to the storyline and keep creating unique content that lives in the GOT universe but does not mimic the original story too closely."
"Tedious...Poor cast, no chemistry, no story, no excitement, no drama, soooo slow, like watching paint dry if not worst. Tried to watch first episode 4 times, forced myself to watch it for the sake of GOT.I cannot understand who posted positive reviews and I don't believe feedback are genuine.Not a single character attracts attention, cannot work out what is this all about. Tried to read a plot but not possible to follow. Strange choice of actors and characters, very strange choice, no attempts to act like kings and queens, didn't like vocabulary and use of language, not enough pompous for me.Dragon scenes in Games of Thones were better and more realistic. Pity pity pity...."
The best introductory episode in the series
The actors played the role really well and the characters were gray and dark
The soundtrack from Ramin Djawadi was more than wonderful and evoked feelings of nostalgia and greatness in this series.
Amazing!Thats the words needed to describe this fantastic show.As a huge GOT-fan i was hoping this would not fail as season 8 did and thank you HBO for not letting us down. It couldve not been done any better. There is allways ppl complaining about stuff but as a book reader ppl have to understand its not easy making a show out of this. I understand the time jumps are annoying but there are no other ways to do it. There are time jumps in the books aswell.This season is perfectly done and it sets up for most likley one of the best seasons of any show coming up in season 2/3/4.Casts are amazing. King Viserys wasnt a favourite to many from start but he proved me and everyone else wrong. His acting specially in episode 8 was outstanding.Daemon is my favourite by far. But the rest are very very good aswell.I cannot wait for season. The dance of dragons will not fail us. 10/10.
World best series. I am huge fan of this universe. I am very excited to see this. Exited to experience what they done. Hope its ending will not like game of thrones.
Great episode They showed us Damon Targaryen and the dragons and the story of Aegon and the new heir and Damon's ferocity when he punished the criminals and fought him in the tournament. Show us his strict justice and how he reacted in the end An impressive episode.
"I am a very huge GOT fan and after watching the first episode of HOTD I am sure that this is going to be legendary.It is crafted very well, direction,acting and other technical aspects looks smooth. Hopefully tere is a lot to come in the upcoming episodes which will make it something to be remembered for a long time."
This is what I need from show it's amazing just classic and king hand remind me of little finger last 20 minutes where outstanding I can't wait for 2 episode and I know this time that showrunners are great and they created probably best episodes of game of thrones nice to see they are making this show can't wait to see legendary politics just a amazing totally worth it watching.
"As someone who has watched Game of Thrones and its awful final , I didn't start House of Dragon with any expectation but I generally liked story. I found story promising even better than Game of Thrones at some time. But relations among people was written awful again. Especially uncle and niece relationship in her young period. But after brother and sister relationship , I can expect everything from them. In Game of Thrones, we have seen this type of relationship which made me shocked and angry at that time and I just thought this awful relationship is written just for one time. But in House of Dragon , we again saw brother and sister relationship which is really irritate me. I understand that this is kind of tradition for continuing their generation. But how can be acceptable to love your brother or sister with passion and intimately? No , that is something to disgust me. And I also know that is not real story , it is just fiction. But even if it is fiction ,doesn't mean that it should be normal or acceptable at least for me. No matter they are fictional characters or not , I have never understand and make sypmathy to these kinds of relationship."
"This is a slow burning greatness. The same vibes of the Game Of Thrones, check! Royal secrecy and political mischiefs, Check! Attaching story, Check! Suspense and unpredictable events, Check! Awesome decor and mood, Check!The first episode is just establishing the mood and storyline, it introduces us to the main characters and tells us who will mess with who but we don't get the full extent of what is about to happen and that's the good news! It's so rich that I can't imagine how the events will unfold in detail.I was always wondering how Daenarys lost her crown and how all those GOT events happened. What led to all that? I'll be following this series very closely for sure. I hope they don't cancel it or trim it because of financial issues.This looks epic and very promising!! I hope they redeem themselves after the debacle of that disastrous final season."
"Your competitor outshines House of the Dragon with Elves, Hobbits, Dwarfs and Humans. The story is far more exciting than the rather mundane story of House... The characters are more entertaining, the costumes more realistic and the images far more intriguing. I've only seen two episodes of the House of the Dragon and I was throughly underwhelmed but have hopes future episodes will dramatically improve and better resemble Game of Thrones. It's possible that the writers of House... were too concerned with establishing the characters of the House of Targaryen and the conflict between brothers that they became unnecessarily bogged down in minutiae. But, the conflict between family members has been overused as well. The House of the Dragon can be considered more closely looks like a true world and the other more fantasy and possibly that is what captured my attention but the quality of the production was better than how House... was presented."
"Poor writing, naturalistic and violent scenes with absolutely no emotional load, mediocre acting, practically no story. This show has none of the things that made GoT fun to watch. There is nothing to hold on to, nothing to remember and certainly nothing that I would like to watch again. Pick one character, scene, piece of dialog you found least least pleasing from the first GoT season, It will still run circles around what this show has to offer.The idea behind it seems to be: Fling money, dragons, authors name, familiar opening credits and some motifs at them. They will gobble it up so fast they will choke on it.It is sad the bar is set so low that this show receives 8.5+ ratings. It is an insult to so many great shows made to this date."
"I am very upset. I supported with ten stars because I love the series, but I am very upset. The reason for changing the actors was at the beginning. The actress was very excellent so far. This new actress is also excellent, but the change is not a good thing. There is nothing in the sixth episode that makes you attracted to watching. It was the worst episode In terms of events, and there is no soul inside the episode, it is like you drink something without taste. The sixth episode made me depressed. All the actors are excellent, but there is no soul, especially in this episode. I support the series with stars. It does not mean that I am satisfied that I love a series. I wish directors and producers to communicate with fans The old series, and I also hope that there will be opportunities in acting. I hope to get a role."
A very wonderful and interesting beginning. I look forward to seeing the rest of the episodes. I hope it will be more beautiful than the series that was before directing and producing a fabulous and very beautiful production.A very wonderful and interesting beginning.

"That sense of impending dread (no one is safe), the beautiful writing and intricate family dynamics coupled with incredible visuals. It's definitely Westeros - this could surpass GoT (as long as the writers keep this up and avoid Starbucks coffee cups).The pacing is perfect - just the right amount of action and suspense. Of course they managed to cram everything that made GoT incredible all into the first episode (plots, intrigue, violence, death, gruesome, tragedy, sexposition, even some foreshadowing...and of course DRAGONS.The lore foreshadowings and family history dynamics are a *chef's kiss*. The writers do a wonderful job of showing the viewer the messiness without falling into the trap other show writers have (ie trying to tell the viewer how to feel). Because of this focus and attention to detail - it's a rollercoaster of emotion..."
"House of the dragon. One of the best shows of 2022 the great concept and execution george r r marting my 2nd favourit writer of all time after vince gilligan i love the world that he built and the different story lines what i love about this show is that it doesnt have so much different story lines you have to keep up with unlike game of thrones the first two seasons we had to keep up with 4-5 different story lines stray,lanister,targaryan,brathion,etc i really love where the show is headed i love how the story started storng and good not okay and builds up to be good most shows starts slow and okay and then starts to grow up to be great no this show started good and even better than game of thrones in my opinion honorable mentions are the great cinematography and the great great use of violence and blood i enjoy R-Rated more than any other rating i look forward to seeing more of this show i hope it goes on to 5+ seasons really exited for the 3rd episode it hasnt dropped just eat but soon it will and i really hope it live up to the hype great show over all defanitly will get even better but great for now."
"Not a hair out of place, yep it's GOT's proper successor alright. Gore, debauchery, dragons and ofcourse solid production value. Did I say that not a single casting(who had a screen time for screen's sake) looked out of place? Though that may be a lot to say in first viewing, but I liked the acting and nothing felt cringe like I felt with one other similar drama(we saw last year). Though the lead didn't feel particularly striking to me, I'd give it time and will definitely finish this season as it comes out. Fingers crossed."
"I mean everything i saw in First episode or pilot is amazing, Dragons looked amazing, Kingslanding looks amazing, characters are portrayed well, Main thing they introduced the characters very well, saw Queen Aemma as literally broad character, Daemon is going to steal the show, that gold Cloaks scene was amazing af, music was dope, tourney was cool loved it and they literally nailed it ðŸ–¤"
"The show is as expected, inchoherent and lacking identity.Trying too hard to be similar to Game of Thrones when it's probably better if they chose to do something totally different and unrelated to Game of Thrones.Too many plots, very little room to digest the information.Too many actors, too many lines, wrong pacing.Milly is the clear star here and I hope the production team allows her to just instinctively take over.I gave this a 7 because I believe this can be better than anything else on TV right now.To all the actors on the show, be more like Milly. Believe in the product, believe in the role. You're getting paid when others are struggling.Earn your wage."
"I didn't expect it to hit so hard from the very first episode. Everything is on point and you feel the atmosphere of the Westeros! I'm very excited for what will happen in the next episodes, but with this filming it seems it will be unforgettable!!!!"
Just watched the last episode and I have to say I have enjoyed this show. The first episode was amazing and got me hooked instantly. Then it was a little boring but then episode 5 was excellent. Then I didn't really like the time skips and all the recasting. I think young Rheneyra and Alicent were really fit for the role and the re casting kinda ruined it for me. But the last episode was great and u can tell that the whole first season was kind of like a set up for something even bigger. The last scene got me shook. However I can see the negatives that a lot of people are reviewing. There isn't really anyone to root for and not a lot of character depth and building going on. That being said it's still a great show and there is a lot of tension and great plot twists and big moments. Doesn't beat GOT tho for sure. Dragons are cool af.
"I witnessed the most boring series ever, i can't imagine the whole budget on this series. Everything happens on one place and this makes it very boring with no action and no real story. The time line is just broken they keep jumping throw the years every episode and the change of two main characters really ???!!Very disappointing series and i am sure the people who ranked it 9 or 10 are bots.I have seen Game of thrones and many other series but this series has nothing to show only bad feelings and memories about game of thrones. I got to the 9. Episode and i was skipping moments where i was feeling very bored. I was never bored from a series i always watch everything till the end but this hell nooo."
"A great start to the series...an episode of an hour and two minutes of enjoyment...the characters showed their meaning...philosophy, mystery and strength..everything was perfect...excited to see the rest."
Amazing show!!! Ryan and Miguel know what they are doing!! Westeros is in great hands!!It feels so good to be back in this world! I was a little skeptical with how this show would be handled after the debacle of the final seasons of game of thrones but I feel like this show is vindicating. Ryans attention to details from the books and Miguel's direction is a perfect match.
"In this day and age where wokeness seems to be everywhere and rule over everything, i had some resentment to watch the show. But so far, it's okay, there's just a pinch of woke in it.The show isn't amazing, but at least it's not boring. Too many ellipses for my taste, i'm still wondering what is the main plot line, a bit predictable.Good acting, i believe, from most of the main actors, at least i believe them when they deliver their speeches.And i don't really know what else to say for now, i'll update this review, in the sea of others (and much better) reviews, later.I didn't read this book, but i sure will now, because i'm pretty sure that it'll be much better than this TV show."
Great performance from the actors and it was very good to see such a good series remembering us by game of thrones and it's actors and actresses and it was very good beginning at the episode one on season one ðŸ’–
"Casting was a disaster it seems, not confident to go with new actors, not bold enough to put money down for great known actors. It's a mixed bag, along with the delivery of lines and the scenes in general come across very flat and uninteresting.Of course a big part of that is the script which is frankly disappointing, given all the time and learning from the complete unmitigated disaster of the last 2 seasons of 'Game of Thrones', it seems the HBO are part of the problem here and it wasn't just David Benioff and D. B. Weiss who were the issue with the script writing department and plot planning in the previous show.In this case the desperation was obvious by the title cards, and the marketing stuff, that keep reminding the viewer that this show is ~150 years prior to Daenerys Targaryen. Not prior to the events of GoT., but prior to Dany. Specifically Dany. The character that they screwed up the most in the entire show. So let's go through this for a second, in GoT the Dany plotline was poorly handled, leading to a terrible ending and a waste of a character that annoyed most of the fans (especially the Dany fans).Why is house of the dragon linked to GoT, and why Dany in particular? I thought it was obvious that people don't want to be reminded of that disaster any more, along with the disappointment of the waste of the other characters such as John (aka an actual true Targarian and heir and king).But it gets worse. For some reason the show blows its load in the first minute by having a dragon fly around the place with a rider on it. Zoom in and play some of Dany's music from the previous show. Like seriously? Playing Dany's theme tune from another show... in this show, which has nothing to do with her or GoT. Frankly it was not only stupid but insulting to the audience."
"HOTD takes us 172 years back from the original series and it is spectacular, I think it is in good hands. Emphasizing on the targaryans,one of the greatest houses and how their persuit of power leads to their doom..I hope this Tv series will fix our hearts that was broken by the way the original series ended.."
"My main point in writing this quick review is because I see so few LEGITIMATE ones posted so far. Anyone who gives this a 1 is simply review bombing, and anyone who gives it a 10 is show simping. Neither of those two scores should be listed to or taken seriously, as this series premier isn't either of those.I was torn between a 6 and a 7, but I went with 7 since I'm probably more skeptical than I should be because of how GoT season 8 went down, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt in my score.I'm not going to get into much about the story bc I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but more of a 10,000 foot viewing of the show, it has promise. Not as good as GoT series premier, but that's to be expected.Reading this (or anyone's) review of a show like this likely won't sway anyone's opinion as they've already decided if they'll watch it or not, but I really wanted to offset the haters and fluffers and say it's good, not great, but that doesn't mean it won't be as the show progresses."
Where should I start? XD
"3 episodes out so far and every new episode gets even better then the previous one. 3rd episode gave me chills right at the beginning. I don't want to put in some spoiler, so I won't describe scenes from the show. I love this show. Great casting, great acting, great music (Ramin of course), great scenes and scenario. Effects and costumes are also really good. Can't wait for new episodes. It's really refreshing series after 2 failures from Amazon. :)"
"Great job again, HBO! Keep up the good work. This is how you respect your fans and people who are paying to watch good show."
"If this series was not related to GOT it wouldnt be a bad show to watch but it does not do GOT any justice. It feels like a period drama, albeit in a fantasy period. GOT did an excellent job balancing action, mystery and drama into a solid story that kept you captivated. This series solely focuses on the drama portion. The actors and cinematography are great but the storyline falls very short. With GOT I was disappointed when an episode emds but with this series I found myself with every episode looking at the clock to see if the episode would be over soon so I can carry on with something else.Maybe I will eat my words and the rest of the season will be spectacular and this first half a season was meant as character building but I still dont feel invested in any characters. They could kill off any of the characters next episode and there would be no disapointment at all."
"I do not have much to say about this ""prequel"" as it seems like we will have another Star Wars case, where original material can not be blindly revisited without hiring actually capable screenwriters and directors. House of Dragon is bland, riddled with cliches, cheap dragon shots with outdated 3D and predictable plot from a start. No character feels in place, except maybe for bad guy, but we do not expect much from them.I can guarantee you that this will be run of the mill fantasy series and this ridiculous 9.1 rating it has how will vanish after nostalgic afterglow of ""finally"" subsides."
"Fantastic show and great cast. Matt Smith is killing it as a Targaryeon. It'll be sad when the time skip happens and we lose Milly Alcock.Art direction, cinematography ,costumes, are great. This is supposed to be the height of the Targaryen's power and one of the opening shots shows King's Landing from aerial view (dragon rider's POV) which I think is very effective and grand.But there are still some excellent scenes thought the episode and it's setting up to be a great series. I already know everything that will happen but will enjoy watching it get fleshed out and seeing new things or changed things."
"I understand why the writers wanted to continue with the hype of GOT, but to do so, you actually have to write a better show. I have yet to see a prequel, or generally a sequel, that is better than the original so I am not sure why they keep trying. Generally, the acting was ok. Not great, some much better than others though. The scenes and costumes on par with GOT. Yet, the writing is disjointed. It jumps through time too quickly. The king lived way too damn long. Just none of it was fitting together for me or adding anything to my interest or understanding of GOT. Sorry, this one was just a miss for me. Not bad, but just missed the mark."
"So, from the starting episodes, HOTD seems to be bit slow and yet they didn't develop some of the characters that well but still, there is excitement about dragons and war and that overshadow that issue. Years gap is an issue but bigger one is that some of the characters who died, i didn't feel anything because i didn't know much about them. Deaths are brutal for sure, and tension especially in ep 9 is like stomach ache. It is impossible to know what going to be happened next. In ep 5, we know about wedding, we know what happen in weddings, their is vibe about something to be happened but from which side, to whom, what goona happen is next to impossible to be known. There is greed for power in every single character except the king TBH. I already watched the season finale, its like time bomb. Give a chance and you not going to regret it. Be patience and as we all know "" Road ahead is uncertain but the end is very clear"" HOTD is amazing, not on same pace of GOT but still one of the best series in 2022."
It's really amazing
House of the dragon gives me really high dose of game of thrones the characters are deep and dark.I really love the first episode and it reminded me what the ward amazing means.
"I mean if you like Game of Thrones, I would give it a watch. The first season is kinda all over the place for me. I really did not like the age jumps between the episodes, that seems like it should have been a seasonal thing; almost seems like they rushed to get to the point they are at currently. It is not a very violent show, but there is TONS of incest in it. A few things just did not make sense to me at all. I have not read any of these books, but the king having this illness and passing out pretty much dead one episode then popping back up next episode which seemed to be like 15 years later to his daughter having all these kids and married was way out of left field. I don't know. I mean watch it, but do not expect GoT at least so far."
The best best best thrilling movie I 've ever seen...its give a feel of scary but still though I love to watch this series all day long without skipping for a minute.... It's Carrying the nostalgia of Game of thrones into this and comparing everything with the original...ii think this is the best thriller and you get the feel of watching original game of thrones... its the same but different characters...Hope we will fall in love with them as the season progresses.... I would recommend everyone to just check out the movies I think no one will disappointed after watching this movie.

"Loved the first show (not the last season), but so far this is more soap than fantasy.You see only the the wealthy ones with their sceems and there is no magic.Nothing happens.A lot of talking about, who should be the next king and sometimes you see a dragon.The casting could have been better and the story could have been more fantasy.Of course, the serie is still running and I do not know how many episodes wil come, but so far"
"the lotr series is way better.There is not one character in the show you could relate too. The Stark family had some members that were sympathic but in the dominant family there is ,so far , no one"
I hope the book comes out soon cause that will bring back the feeling.
Why is the production value so dark? At least GoT you can see what is happening. Was there a limited costume/scenery budget issue? It is unwatchable just staring at a black screen. So I switched to GoT and can see just fine. Obviously its not my TV settings. Or maybe this show is only made for people with some special TV? I have a new 65 inch Samsung located in a room that doesn't get much light and a large screen in a basement movie theater room. Both so dark it was unbearable to watch and I ended up changing to something else. Disappointing. Maybe the production folks should consider spending a little more on some lighting...or maybe better writing/acting won't require all of the drama to come out of the overused dark mood lighting.
"As a fan of both show and books I was a tad sceptical about this new show especially after the way GoT finished with it's frankly pathetic last season.I honestly enjoyed the first episode it has the familiarity you'd expect but lacks the mystery, if you're a fan you know most of the backstory already but I still found it entertaining.I've always thought that Matt Smith looks a bit shifty and I think he, Paddy Considine and Rhys Ifans are particularly good at establishing the characters and main plot.I miss GoT particularly the earlier still based around the books seasons, hopefully this new show won't fall into the same trap as the original."
"First of all i want to say that we all were disappointed from the last season of Game of Thrones but once a fan always a fan.House of the Dragon is a must watch if you love Game of Thrones. The character development , feeling , atmosphere , world , music AND DRAGONS.. everything is brilliant.Ofcourse its the beginning of the series and we all need to find out where it will bring us eventually but if its keeps the same level as this first episode we will have a crazy enjoyable time. Im looking forward ! I hope you all too."
Binged seasons 1-7 of GoT so
those episodes are still very fresh in my mind
and I am unaffected by rose tinted nostalgia.I've just watched episode 1 of House of the
"Dragon.How can I sum it up? So far, so good.The music is sufficiently different to be fresh"
while remaining recognizable. The production
quality and cinematography are as expected
"fantastic, epic and awe inspiring, aside from a"
couple of excessively dark scenes that were
"over and done with very quickly.There is gore aplenty. Nudity, vomit, sex and"
depravity. Incidental background humor. A
promise of things to come.The casting seems to be on point - I saw no.
"Besides bots and trolls I have to wonder why some reviewers are dissing this.The production is stunning visually and the sound including the music is great.I've knocked points off for some of the acting......particularly for Elrond and Galadriel- they've not wholly convinced me yet but early days with the first two episodes.I have not read the books other than the ""...Rings"" and The Hobbit but I found the pacing and story development fine as well as the intro to most of the characters.I am far from colour blind and feel it's more ""real"" (yes even in fantasy) to have people of colour in our shows. Certainly looking forward to my Friday night TV."
Only negatives
-some wigs look odd(the ling has a greying black bird but has silver hair which doesn't look quite right)
-the cgi of the dragons is slightly worse than s8 GoT but this is the first episode and weve only properly seen one dragon yet
"the casting for rhaenyra is off, milly alcock in my view has the face for a commoner not a royal.Basically perfect start otherwise."
"Writing this review after only one episode. Strong first episode. I'm a huge fan of the novels. And in the minority that liked the end of GoT on HBO. As always on HBO, the cast and visuals are outstanding. The characters are bold but not overdone, and I'm sure will have depth. Matt Smith as Damon Targaryen and Molly Alcock as Rhaenyra Targaryen stood out. Since the story is drawn from some GRRM history rather than novels, the writers have a lot of freedom with this story. I think they did a great job of continuing the overall vibe of Westeros but with enough change in style to make it interesting and worth watching. Plus, it feels more like a 4 season show."
"Has a nostalgic feel of game of thrones and seems to be very promising from the first episode that's come out. Hopefully we won't be disappointed with the episodes to come, it feels good to hear the song of ice and fire again."
"In a time of peace, House of The Dragon (HoD) starts off slowly. The politicking wears down the weak (King Viserys), while sharpening the predatory (Daemon Targaryen). Princess Rhaenyra proves to be a fighter and survivor despite her young age.HoD compares poorly to GOT in terms of the secondary characters. The dynamics of the Stark siblings. Arya Stark and Sandor ""The Hound"". The Lannisters and the Tyrells. The villains Littlefinger and Ramsey Bolton. The desperate defence against the Night King and his White Walkers.That said, HoD gets very realistic about the subordinate role of women in conservative society. And, the very real dangers and pain of child bearing.It remains to be seen if HoD has the reach to be an epic. Matching the the twisted journeys of Daenerys and Sansa Stark toward their destinies!"
"I can't imagine what season 2,3 will be like after the first 5 episodes I realized that the writers will not let us down like GOT (7,8) didEverything seems great about this showFIRE AND BLOODIf I'm sad I'll be sad in one thing"
How danyeres Targaryen and agon Targaryen Aka Jon snow ended on GOT they deserve a lot betterI want and all the fans want to remake S7 and S8After GRRM finish the 2 booksAnd after house of dragons ends all their seasonsWe will watch a magnificent masterpiece with S7 and S8
And maybe more 9 or 10 so the show can ends like the books and maybe much better HBO LISTEN TO US GRRM LISTEN TO US.
"Simply put, the series is missing something. In my opinion, the series deals with less interesting topics most of the time. All I remember is that someone is always giving birth to someone and the political plots are too boring compared to Game of Thrones.The world is interesting, although not as interesting as in Game of Thrones. Somehow I don't like child/young actors, some of them look like 30-year-old men, others like small children, but they are supposed to be the same age.The plots seem simple and elaborate to me, the editing is rushed, it doesn't have the necessary depth. Yes it is better than rings of power, wheel of time and blood origin. But it still falls short of Game of Thrones qualities."
"After 8 episodes, I give up.I feel like I am watching a soap opera and not even a good one. None of the characters are interesting, they don't have any depth, I don't feel like I want to root for any of them.The writing is bad, the direction is bad, the story is bland and uninteresting.I had to skip forward so many times because the scenes were being dragged for so long and most of the characters where just looking at each other without saying a word or they were just looking at the distance.They use sex scenes and violence as a way of keeping it interesting I guess, but even those scenes are so boring and add nothing to the story.I thought the last season of GOT was the biggest disappointment but this show definitely takes the cake."
"It is unique and the presence of dragons makes the series more exciting.Also, the beautiful soundtrack of Ramin Javadi, a composer of Iranian descent, makes the series more enjoyable.Please don't rate Breaking Bad and Lord of the Rings fans."
"What a start. Next level storytelling, cinematography, vfx, sfx, and once again the acting is done beautifully. Bravo. Can't wait for more. Ramin back at it with a immense score."
"In GAME OF THRONES we have the biggest script plot I've ever seen on the screens , a network of intrigues totally tied up that shows what human ambition and greed in search of power is capable of, by various houses or families of the kingdoms.In HOUSE OF THE DRAGON, a spin-off that takes place before the first series mentioned above, apparently the network of intrigues would be smaller , because the series takes place during the reign of a family ( or who knows of its fall ) that because that family has several dragons, it has the power.While GOT brings us politics prevailing in its first seasons, leaving dragons and other supernatural themes with nightstalkers as if they were legends, here they are a reality. In principle, no other family tends to question out of respect and fear of dragons, so the plot will only take place within the Targaryen family .We have the question of tradition of succession of the male throne being broken and the king viserys coming to choose his daughter over his impulsive and violent brother, but without forgetting that he himself inherited the throne because he was a man despite his sister being older. A king who lives for the kingdom, just thinking about everyone's well-being, both financially and in entertainment. Since producing a great miniature of his Kingdom, how much to live to have a son, who did not succeed because his wife, in an excellent dialogue with his protagonist daughter Rhaenyra, says that women have the power to possess the ""real uterus"", coming to have several births, but with stillbirths and abortions, without being able to put a man in the world.In addition to all this grandiose script, epic track with the 3/4 GOT melodies, good performances, beautiful photography and even superior production design, house of the dragon did not let the climate escape, besides respecting the whole universe already exposed by R. R. Martim , managed in an hour of episode to expose all the wealth of details and internal conflicts as if the one with the throne has dragons? Or who has dragons has the power of the throne? But does the throne accept it ?"
"This is exactly what I was waiting for almost four years ,, a new start for Targaryen dynasty ,, to see the real power behind this name,, the first episode is actually a masterpiece by all means,, can't wait to see the rest of this show,, good work Miguel .."
"Set about 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, the era of House of the Dragon follows the trials and tribulations of the House Targaryen during the period of a tenuous peace.Thankfully the American fantasy drama House of the Dragon is more of the Game of Thrones same. The writing, directing, and cast performances are notable. Although the fantasy elements are off the bat, it by default loses it's build up and reveal that its predecessor had, the dragons effects are done well for the most part, there's plenty of realistic gore and blood throughout. Credit to the casting director, the young cast portrayals of the later older characters are uncannily fitting, Milly Alcock is particularly memorable. Paddy Considine gives a breakout performance, Matt Smith at last gets to show off his acting chops. Rhys Ifans oozes screen presence.While the foul language and sexual depictions have lost their edge with every TV show trying to shoe horn it in, it services the story to some extent. Still, there are some wince inducing gratuitous scenes which seem to go out of their way simply to shock.It's a tight production, and even though it feels smaller in scale and scope when compared to its predecessor, there's enough twists to keep you hooked. Recommended."
"We're certainly in Westeros here. The feel of the sets, costumes and CGI hits those authentic notes and transports us right back to our favourite fictional continent.This is very entertaining and interesting stuff. The feminist aspect of the story is kept to an acceptable level of screechiness, whilst the acting and dialogue are largely top notch; stuffed with the pith and intrigue we're used to from this franchise.My only issue so far, is that HoTD lacks the scope of its predecessor. We spend all of our time time in Westeros (mainly in King's Landing) and for the moment, we're without the thrill of being transported to the far-flung cities of Essos. It does make the show feel a little 'smaller', but hopefully this will change in time."
"Since I read the book I am quite excited for several characters to appear, some of them just on the side at first but man... there will be some stuff happening (if they stick to the book).First off, I only watched until episode 4 so far but I wanted to write this review early as usually the last 10 minutes of a season brainwash me too much and cloud my general judgment too much as those last 10 minutes almost always are an ""amazing"" part. And sometimes I find it poor film making if besides this moment I've been bored.Some people here find the show to fast, others too slow. Well, I guess everyones taste is different.The thing about giant time jumps is a thing in the book though. It's written like a history book so sometimes in 2 sentences a king or princess is introduced and put aside at the same time. That's how the book works and I can accept it therefore in the show.If I look neutrally at it I gotta say though that if it wouldn't have GRRMs stamp on it I probably wouldn't continue it with much excitement. It feels to me like a normal fantasy-medieval series. Nice as I like the genre but nothing I would recommend too eagerly.The graphic brutality is in my opinion less stromg which takes some of the excitement for me. Also much more of the CGI is obvious in this series: cities and creatures mostly. The dragons for me also look less real than in the last moments of GoT.Overall I feel the quality is quite a bit lower in this series. But to be fair that's how it is usually jn a first season of a new series (but is this series really new?)"
"So much to say about this pilot but first and foremost a massive salute to the all that were involved with this project.The depth this show takes to foreshadow the future is incredible. As a fan of the book I have a good idea how the show will progress and to those that haven't read the book episode 1 will be an episode I'd highly suggest rewatching at the end of the season.What truly makes these shows so incredible is the complexity in writing and how events were staged to set the story to come. Pay attention to the small details especially from the scenes of the kings council and those of The Hightower family.Supporting characters do much foreshadowing through this episode and how the writers worked in House Valerian really shows the complexity they will bring to the ""game of thrones""...Damon's character Ark was meticulously laid out and I have nothing but high expectations for both the actor and the writes ability to continue to evolve this character much like we saw Jamie Lannister evolve from the core series.My only con I have is sometimes the events felt "" sped up"" especially the scenes of violence. Somestimes slowing the fights down builds suspense and kinetic excitement to the audience, I couldn't help but feel like some of these fights where rushed. It's a personal gripe and a Nitpicky want it that, over all it was absolutely what we have come to expect from HBO.Besides that absolutely incredible."
"It's just good enough to watch it. Pilot and episode 5 were good. Same Season 1 GOT, where Ep. 2-4 were setting the plot. But everything feels a little worse:Too few characters, so no suprises and crazy fan theories. Yes, it's house of dragon and focuses on them. But 2-3 more secrets and betrayals to work from would be betteryMost of the people kinda get along and just chill in their noble bubble. Exactly 1 ingrigue/secret is the theme from now on and it came by episode 5.The cast is ok, GOT cast was genius.Feels like they picked all the second choices from GOT. Yes, it takes time to grow into chracters, even if they are charismatic. It's ok."
"It's hard to compare any series with its predecessor but we do it anyway and I'm going to do it now. Loved GOT. Watched it many times. Acting, locations, costumes, action, story, etc. Were all wonderful. Don't know WTF happened in the last season, but let's leave that aside.The new series is impossible to see or hear. Shooting in the candlelight may be a nifty idea, but it makes it hard to see many of the scenes., But even if you could see the scenes, you still can't understand what they're saying. Mumbling quickly in strange British accents does not make for a good time.BTW - my hearing is good as is my vision, so it's not me.Update - I sat through 4 episodes, trying my best to hear though the lighting did get better. I missed nothing. Acting is mediocre, there are many plot flaws, and no one to cheer for nor anyone to hate. What a sad sequel to what a marvelous series."
"The first episode is very wonderful very good I'm eagerly waiting for the upcoming episodes. It's great to live in an atmosphere Unfortunately, Jon Snow is not here."
"I really liked Game of Thrones. Had no real expectations regarding this new show, so I went in having seen only one trailer.Halfway into the first episode, I could feel how tense my body was. The episode was exciting and ominous. I felt invested, more than I ever was with Game of Thrones. This was something similar, yet different. A downside with Game of Thrones for me was that the story was so fractured, jumping between several houses and separate storylines. House of the dragon is much more focused, showing only house Targaryen and it's interesting to see more of what happened before Game of Thrones.After just two episodes I feel more hooked on this show than with Game of Thrones. However, the quality of actors, photo, music, sound and script feel just as tight as Game of Thrones. The big difference is the more narrow focus, but I feel it's a big improvement.I eagerly await the upcoming episodes!"
I liked but the quality its like dark mode we cant aee everything well and hopefully will be better cus there was no youngs people at all.We just waiting the next episode
and they didnt taked about stark family.
"What a show. I believe that this is even better than GOT! Got my attention right from the start and I'm so happy it's been so good. Brilliant and I hope there's many more spin offs to come!! The videography, the story, the whole show has got me hooked again especially after the final episode of GOT! It's well worth the watch and Matthew smith is exceptional ! Looking forward to see how the show progresses through the seasons. The story so far is even more than expected. The cast are brilliant and the effects are unreal. It's hard to follow up on a fantastic show but it's has me totally hooded. Bravo!"
"Good first episode, well built and structured. Lot of interesting good actors that I'm looking forward to see them perform in the rest of the season.Plot was interesting with the succession of the King. The dialogue was just good enough and hope they keep quality here. The last GOT seasons were not so great due to the huge loss of dialogue quality."
"The beginning of the first episode is slow and filled with diplomatic dialogue, leaving you to wonder if they've fumbled the bag on continuing the GoT series. They over-compensate for that with gore, sex, and intense fighting scenes early on which brings you back into full attention. The ending of the first episode leaves you excited for the next episode and wanting more. I will say that the young Targaryen princess isn't very like-able and wasn't casted well in my opinion, but she has large shoes to fill in the bloodline of Daenerys.Seems as if a lot of reviewers aren't locked in for the potential of this show and the upcoming battles. I saw a lot of 4 star reviews - it's worth at least 6 or 7 stars."
"So to get hyped for this new show, I started rewatching the original GoT. I probably shouldn't have because all it makes me do is realize how much better the original started off. I will keep watching, and I hope it finds it's identity eventually but right now it's just a good show, not great.Story moves too fast, the dialogue isn't even nearly on par with the original, plot points are way too overt and obvious. Most characters aren't interesting. This show seems to focus on the aspects of latter episodes of GoT rather than early ones - quickly form a subplot and resolve it even faster and throw in lots of action and dragons."
"After last episode (06) a storm of trolls downgrade the rating of the show, writing nonsense and unreal criticism. Don't bother yourself and read them. It's the same trolls who write positive unreal criticism about The Rings of Power and vote over 8.The sixth episode was full of everything we love in G. R R Martin's world. I really enjoy Larry Strong's monolog (always near to the flowers) - it reminds me Littlefinger's lines about the ""ladder and chaos"" , but here we listen bad omens about children and love in front of power. The main materials for an upcoming Civil War. Marvelous score by Ramin Djawadi on this episode. I loved it.Lena's death by fire is the heart of this episode, though an unexpected plot twist far away from book ""Fire and Blood"". I thing producers want Veagar changing dragon rider earlier and that's great! I loved Elena's little profecy about Aemon's ""closing eye"", as also the actress herself, presents a future lonely and depressed Targaryan far away from others. Prince's Aegon and Aemon are fine casting, I liked their acting, Lena' s daughters also, pretty decent. The most exciting, though, are Emma D'Arcy and Olivia Cook. Their chemistry is enough to describe the future of the realm. 10 years left their signs on them, more neurotic behavior for Allicent, more mental depress for Rhaenyra.Daemon's costume at Pentos was beautiful and Finely, the Dragon Pit looks great and huge. I hope we see more scenes there."
"I watched House of the Dragon because my parents said it was good. I enjoyed Game of Thrones (until series 8) so I had high hopes.Honestly I was dissapointed, my parents called it a 'slow burner' but I say its more like an extinct flame.It seems like most episodes are 99% talking - either in ye olde English or Valyrian with subtitles that disappear as quick as they come.Its all polotics with endless boring small council meetings, plotting and scheming with policial alleigances through marriage and births.And a few overly graphic birthing scenes.I was confused by the opening credits, a stream of blood over rock that kept dividing and sinking emblems as it went. I eventually had to Google it to find the meaning. And even then it didn't truly makes sense as I did not recognise any of the sigils anyway.Thats another point against it, there no logical explanation to it, at least in GoT it became recognisable as depicting a map of Westeros with locations currently in the programme.It may have been more recognisable for those who have read the books, but not for me.With all the time jumps I can recognise the adults ok but the children are somewhat a mystery and takes me a while to recognise that that 20-something year old is the baby in the last episode.When suddenly they did a very long time jump in episode 8, there suddenly was a tall, mature Targaryen prince with an eyepatch calling the dark haired prince's ""nephews"""
"I spent most of the episode thinking, who is this new uncle that we have never seen before? It took most of that episode before I realised that he was the young boy in episode 7 who got his eyes slashed, and that biologically he IS their uncle not thier cousin.There were of course a few things I enjoyed watching, but they were quite few and far between and nothing lasted long before it went back to more talking and politics.A few spoilers.The fight for 'The Step Stones' in Episode 2 was the first good part of the series but it didn't last very long. It ended with the potential of a good fight that was ruined by the arrival of a dragon, then an epic fight in the cave that was never shown. Even the good episode ended in disappointment.The only other real action from then until epsiode 7 was Damon killing his wife in the Vale.The burning of the former Captain, and secret father of Rhaenyra's children. More on the paternity plot that was an endless topic of conversation that was little more than talk.Damon refusing to kill his second wife in childbirth - ironically choosing the opposite action (or inaction) to what his brother did, only for her to commit suicide thereby killing herself anyway and the baby, so it had the exact same outcome.There was some excitement finally in Episode 7 with the boy taking the dragon and the ensuing childrens fight (the aforementioned eye slashing). Then the assasination of Rhaenyra's husband so she could marry the uncle (quite a sickening marriage to me)Its otherwise been quite dull to watch so overall not inpressedMy parents told me episode 10 was a very good one, but in truth it was more of the same talking and scheming - finally, at the end, there was some action as the boy and his uncle with the eyepatch were both trying to convince the same man to join their side, resulting in the dragon chase that ended with the young boy being killed, and his dragon half eaten and torn apart (which I personally think was entirely the young boys fault as he attacked the far bigger dragon which made it angry and disobey it's rider)I am not sure if there will be a series 2, but based on this first one, I will not be bothered with it."
What they had was:
"An exiting fantasy universe, filled to the brim with background and inspirationA truckload of money to spend on sets, costumes, special effects, musicAn enormous fanbase eager to consume every scrap of content they producedWhat they didn't have:"
"The story and the rich intrigue and dialogues from George R. R. Martins many long long years of writingHow did we ever hope the result to be anything more than a beautiful looking mess? The lack of depth is painfully masked by drama or gore that feels out of place. The many recognizable features from GoT give us glimmers of hope, but soon we realize this show just canibalizes our fond memories in pursuit of easy revenue. The plotlines of strive and rivalry are paper thin or turn out to be irrelevant later on. Characters with poor motivation or barely a background make inexplainable decisions at the most unlikely moments. Events unfold at an incredible pace, skipping random leaps of time without the slightest explanation, yet many scenes are filled with dreadfully slow and boring conversations just to fill the episode. The few worthwile performances and chemistry are quickly forgotten as character's actors are changed and the little sympathy we build up is lost.Money buys you a great many things, but it can't buy a good story.Shame... ding ding."
"Very neatly executed episode, if the series heads in this direction then it will definitely emerge as one of the better shows at par with the first few seasons of GOT.. the characters are really likeable and yes it has a lot of nudity, again at par with GOT ;)"
"Having read the.""Fire & Blood"" History this is based on a lot of great material to work with. Keep up the quality of the character stories along with the special effects and this can be a winner. It feels a bit slow at first but I expect that to change soon enough as plot lines develop. I am also very pleased that HBOMax is releasing one a week rather than force viewers into a marathon in order to avoid online spoilers."
"As for the aggrandizement of House of The Dragon, it is fair to say that there are many very well-crafted and developed characters in this series (King Viserys, Rhaenyra, Daemon, Alicent, Otto Hightower, Criston Cole, Rhaenys...). But in terms of plot, there is no mystery whatsoever, apart from a few minimal moments of subverting expectations interspersed with shocking visual violence. We all know that war (A Dance with Dragons) is coming, and that on one side will be the supporters of Rhaenyra Targaryen and on the other side will be the supporters of Alicent Hightower. I think the series suffers a lot from this kind of predictability and that's a highly negative point. On the other hand, contrary to the immense quality photography of Rings of Power, we have this House of The Dragon exclusively focused on the corridors of three great palaces: Red Keep, Dragonstone and the only new place: Driftmark. That said, let me tell you, this series is a far cry from its predecessor Game of Thrones and is also the antipodes of what is a perfect series. But people love shocking violence and shocking acts of nudity and depraved sexuality."
"As someone who wasn't following the HotD hype-train, I went in with no expectations, and came out pleasantly surprised.The episode opens with subpar narration and text which did little to impress. The main blow in the first few minutes, however, came from the lack of an actual title theme/credits - it was just a Targaryen symbol closing in accompanied by generic medieval sounds (Ramin Djawadi why?).After the title, the episode wastes no time in introducing us to the main characters. The two central characters are Rhaenyra and Daemon, both with the conflicting desire to be the next ruler of Westeros. Rhaenyra, I found to be quite uninteresting, due to her passive nature throughout the episode (the most interesting thing about her is she reminds me of the other more famous dragon lady zzz). Thankfully, Daemon is on the opposite end of the spectrum, an ambitious whoring sadist played by a gleeful Matt Smith, adding to Throne's repertoire of privileged psychopaths.Other key players include the naive King Viserys Targaryen (a crushed and soon to be dead man), hand of the king Otto Hightower (whose motivations I can't quite place, an interesting character), Corlys Velaryon (similar to Otto, can't place him yet) and royal prince and heir-for-a-day Baelon Targaryen (honestly though Daemon would assassinate him) (rip in peace).Most of these characters are well written and acted. The dialogue is much more business-like and to the point this time around, mostly devoid of banter (this makes sense as a majority of interactions are between older men). Moving on to pacing, the progression felt natural, and the episode culminated with the birth of Baelon juxtaposed with the Daemon's jousting sequence, both of which were exciting scenes with good payoff.The music was mediocre - the drums that played during the jousting sequence were stimulating, but everything else I heard were rehashed themes from GoT, and thus the music as a whole was lacking identity. I found the sets and CGI to be decent (not as pretty as GoT), but the greatest offender were the Targaryen wigs, which were to put plainly - horrendous.Overall though, the first episode of HotD does its job well enough to make me want the next. It feels like a less complex GoT at the moment, which in its first episode introduced us to ~20 distinct characters by comparison.PS - In the future, I wish they introduce new regions. I heard talk of Dorne, Dragonstone, the Vale and while I look forward to revisiting these locations, something fresh would be very welcome."
"3 Episodes in, I am honestly thrilled with what I've seen. Coming back to this world was not exactly a nerve inducing experience, as the last 2 seasons of GOT left a bitter taste, House of the Dragon was a simply an ""I'll give it a go"" show, I was optimistic but I held myself back from getting excited.Happily, HBO bringing this show into my life has rekindled the same wonder and excitement that I felt during season 3-6 of GOT. GOT for many of us showed us just how good TV could be, and even though HOTD isn't destined to be considered the best show all time, it has lifted a massive shadow that the conclusion of GOT cast over the world.The cast is just excellent; the cinematography is on point; the script and characters are both engaging and complex; the sets are grand and meticulously detailed. Most of all the costume designers have truly outdone themselves, I usually do not give a lot of thought to costume when watching film, but the work that has been done here is incredible.I can not wait to watch more and I hope they continue creating content to this standard."
"I give it 8 stars because I'm still optimistic it can turn around. I read Fire and Blood so I know the content is there. I was curious how HOT would address the jump between generations.I think they could have done it much better, maybe with more flashbacks or something, especially with more backstory of Jaehaerys and prior kings.The acting has been pretty solid. Needs more grit, action, clever doings, etc. So far, it's a little too uneventful and slow. Feels like a high budget soap opera. HOT is failing to maintain continuity with the cruel and tribal nature of Westeros as depicted in GOT."
U will enjoy the show if you loved GOT.U will enjoy the show if you loved GOT. U will enjoy the show if you loved GOT. U will enjoy the show if you loved GOT.
"I have seen 3 episodes so far and the characters begin to have their own personalities and the story is unfolding you can see and feel the tension growing. I do think it is a solid eight so far It is even (maybe) a nine in the future. If and If they keep the momentum and storyline going you can never tell sometimes directors do crazy things somewhere along the way.The scenes are beautiful and a bit nostalgic and familiar with the original first serie. Also the acting is very good, especially when you get to know the characters a bit and their personalities. I can't wait to find out how the story will unfold as an older guy i'm rooting for the young Rhaenyra Targaryen normally girls during those ancient times had limited choices she might be in a position to spread her wings especially if she in the future will take the throne and has to fight to keep it.Some things where unexpected and a bit off, but seeing that the author. George R. R. Martin has approved this serie as it is, who am I to complain about those little things. Seeing the Story is Solid the Acting is Good the Graphics are well done.I give it a 8 out of 10."
"I am a big GoT fan and naturally looked very forward to this spin-off. Sadly, after five episodes in I had to call it quits. The characters are tediously shallow and there is just nothing compelling about them to make me care about the trials and tribulations in their lives. As a woman I found myself especially turned off by the whiny female characters. A good portion of their dialog and situations are devoted to vilifying pregnancy and motherhood, so much so it makes me wonder did the writers completely forget the maternal instinct shown from female characters in GoT? Daenerys Targaryen grieved for her lost child. Gilly loved her baby boy. Talisa was looking forward to giving birth. And there were no woeful anti-pregnancy lectures from either Catelyn Stark or Cersei Lannister. Then there is the problem with the graphic visuals in House of the Dragon. Aside from the initial first scene in episode1, the special effects veer swiftly off into the bad. The CGI dragon flying scenes lack quality and the integration with the actors is wonky. The last and probably most disappointing issue is the overall feel of the show. I was expecting high adventure, intriguing drama and richly imaginative sword and sorcery elements, but instead HOTD plays out like a cheesy soap opera. With all the flaws I feel the hours given in hopes of being entertained by House of the Dragon turned out to be nothing but a disappointing waste of my time."
"Didn't watch a lot of prequel, because eventually you'll know what the ending would be.This show is going to be amazing, we all know how this is going to end, but we decided to watch it nevertheless.I hope each main character develops in a good way, I hope its ending is not rushed like GOT.GRRM is an amazing author, If he's happy with this show, I am!!!"
"To whomever claims that this is too slow or not as exciting as the original GoT. You are the reason why GoT went to crap for the last 3 seasons. Season one of GoT was just as slow as this if not worse, and it took the time and pace to build up the plot to make the twists later on plausible. If you want explosions go watch a Michael Bay movie.I am glad House of Dragon takes time to build up the characters and patiently explains the relationship between each one of them. So far the pace feels perfect. CGI is not as good as some of the Marvel movies, but this is a TV show, so budget is different. And the cast, the cast is great too. Surely some of the younger actors/actresses have flaws, but I really don't think the original GoT's young actors/actresses are perfect either.So all in all, this is a great start of another milestone of television."
"Since the moment House Of The Dragon was announced, I have been anticipating this day. Some people believed it would just be another fan service prequel, but hotd proved them wrong. This is how a beginning should be constructed. The plot moved quickly. They introduce characters quickly, but they do so successfully.My expectations were met by Caraxes and Syrax. This episode included blood, so it's time to wait for more blood and fire of dragons. I am totally into it and can't wait for another week to watch the second episode. The acting of Matt Smith, Paddy Considine, Milly Alcock, and Emily Carey was flawless."
"When you come down I will tell you but I am sure it will be legendary. And a small part of the next story, break how wonderful this show will be. We started from the sixth episode, the last episodes are just a building for what is to come. The characters and visual effects are more than wonderful. They do not have a single source from the book of symptoms, which makes the series unexpected for readers, and it will be a separation point for me from many facts. At the end, it will be part of the truth and another part of it. And another part of the speculation about the stories and the judicial ones inside the book. The show will surprise you a lot."
"Here is the hard truth that no one has the heart to tell GOT fans , this series is better than GOT. Now I know what some of the reviewers have complained about yes they used danys theme yes they talk about the prophecy yes there is a princess who is unhappy and wants to be her own master . But dear viewer you are all falling for the same trap as you did with GOT, just as dany wasn't a savior and there were always signs that khaleesi was either not very well in head or a tyrant and many people ( including viewers) chose to overlook it and cheered for her ( oh so the woman who threatened everyone with fire actually burnt a city ? Shocker!!!!) they are all either cheering for Rhaenyra or mocking her feminist agenda! She is not a feminist she is not a beacon of women's empowerment she is a power hungry person( never mind her gender) Other characters are no better because that's what Martins stories are about, absolute power corrupts absolutely! Targaryens ( Valyrians before them ) are epitomes of absolute power , men like Viserys and Jahaeryc are anomalies in that house Deamon Deanerys and the likes of them are norm , arrogant cruel ; tyrants the lot of them. There is a reason why Deamon enjoys personally executing poor defenseless petty criminals ( without trials without a word ) he is a tyrant Rhaenyra booing a crowd of commoners is because she is a tyrant in making Colrys Velaryon urging his 12 year old girl to marry a middle aged man is because he is tyrant, this is a show about mostly unlikable people struggling for more power of course we are not supposed to root for any of them. Because what would be the point if we did?"
"I'm hoping for an interesting story but it may be hard to beat the GOT.For now, I quietly give 8 we will see how the story will develop and if it will be engaging and interesting."
"Watch this last night, overall, I enjoyed it. It was very dark (lighting). There were a few scences that were very dark and hard to tell who was doing and or saying what. They could stand to brighten it up a little. Love the young actress they have playing young Rhaenyra Targaryen. The rest of the cast fit very well too. The dragons looked amazing. I look forward to seeing more of them.Can't wait to see where they take it over the season and beyond."
"I did not want the episode to end, different from last seasons of GOT where I had no patience. First episode of House of the Dragon was like wine tasting. It gave you time to enjoy, even though there was a lot they took their time and they combined many scenes which was a work of art. The characters are complex which makes everything more interesting, and people can relate too if confronted with a similar situation. It is a show to make you think, and of course there's everything we want about sex, blood, and great dialogue. If you want just silly action go back to season 7 and 8of GOT. Now, if you like to pay attention to details House of the Dragon is your show. Can't wait for more! We are ready for dragons."
"I just wanna comment on one thing,It's a really hard thing to do to make a spin-off and keeping the same quality with the original. House of Dragons did it so well and started so good and simple. Story in my opinion didn't so complex as Game of Thrones but story progressed in a clever way. We saw only what is necessary.As story progressed characters started to explore different parts of their journey.I fell in love with the first five episodes butwho told that changing two loved characters & keeping all others as ""older versions"" is a good idea?It's not, think it as you watch Jon Snow as Kit Harrington and suddenly story jumps 15 years and Kit Harrington changes with X, Emilia Clarke changes with Y and all other actors/actresses are the same?Okey i understand this is a different concept, but seriously?"
"The first few episodes were intriguing at best. It was at the fast forward point that everything completely crashed and burned. I'm finding that this show is amounting to nothing more than a soap opera set in medieval times. It boggles me that by episode 7 we have a crew of characters who are 100% unlikeable and sorely underdeveloped. Where's the honor? Who's the badass? Who's the one with humor and wit? We've got a crew of greedy, whining losers who are greedy, whining losers for... what? Their motives are weak and fleeting; their actions are just flat out annoying. Which deplorable loser am I supposed to be rooting for and why?GOT had the good, the bad, and the ugly fleshed out to the T. I could appreciate and empathize with Cersei or Joffrey just as much as I could with Arya or Jon. What can I appreciate about any of the character's we have in this show?Okay, that's enough. Overall, I'm thoroughly surprised at how well received this show appears to be in the ratings. As a GOT fan, it's a major let down."
"This show should be on HGTV, cuz they made this Dragon House a real Dragon Home. All of the things we loved about Game of Thrones (games, thrones) is here but they haven't forgotten what the real fans love (Houses, Dragons). Also things like bad guys and good guys and some people you aren't sure of their loyalty, while others seem ""sus"", and others you get a weird feeling about (trust that feeling!). The dude in the white wig and armor was a badass, I think he was on Dr House from the BBC before. Loved the dragon girl - hope things work out for her. Also: the dude who's like ""yeah, I'm the man,"" but the fan favorite is like ""I DON'T THINK SO!!"""
"From my point of view the showrunners Miguel and Ryan delivered an epic first episode introducing us to the house targaryen in their absolute power and dragons. The outstanding performance of the actors in the first episode gave us a clear view to the nature of the characters, for example Daemon Targaryen and his brother the king Viserys I.I love Miguel perspective of the seeing things in house of the dragon and I am sure that he and Ryan will deliver an excellent story, and with the guidance of the one and only Goerge R R Martin i think this is gonna be successful show like game of thrones."
"I thought I could never forgive the world of Game of Thrones for what they did in season 8, what a disaster. But I came around and have now watched the first 3 episodes of HOTD and I am blown away. Love this series already. It's epic, it's faster paced than thrones which I personally enjoy, the characters of all houses are all awesome in their own way, the fighting is like the battle of the bast**ds but add dragons, and is the best show I've seen in recent history with all of the sludge coming from marvel, Star Wars and the rather disappointing rings of power. This show is dope and believe it or not I'm not a shill. Go watch HOTD!"
Well done for pilot episode. The cinematography and sequence of the scene are good. I hope the quality will remain or increase as the episodes goes by.
"The first episode does a splendid job at setting the framework for this show. The narrative is engaging and different perspectives and interesting stakes are introduced for most characters thus far. This series has the potential to show that the world Martin has created still has a lot to offer, and I'm here for the ride.I would rate this episode a 9 out of 10, but there seems to be a trend where people give low ratings to shows for the most preposterous reasons. I'm adding that one extra point for the fact that the show is willing to show a story that extends beyond the vision of your average white man. It's quite outrageous that people criticize and one star-rate a show for displaying the struggle a royal person of the female gender faced in a medieval time setting, or god forbid containing characters with black (!^) skin.. Dragons, zombies, a vast world with many different cultures and groups, but blacks from Valyria.. Oh how the mighty have fallen!Get off your high horse and enjoy the show for its actual quality."
"This show is everything i expected the show to be. The first episode looks amazing and so full of potential. I cant wait to see what they could do with the story, regarding the world of Westeros. I hope they maintain their practicability, and unpredictability way of story telling. I'm already loving some of the characters especially, matt smiths character. Finally, a show that has a potential to fill the shoes of the Game of Thrones."
"After 6 episodes, I lost any hope. This show is just not going anywhere nor is getting any better. The plot is boring. It feels more like Downtown Abbey in a fantasy setting/world rather than GOT, but without the likeable and interesting characters. And this is the even bigger issue: the uninteresting flat characters that come and go (die) without giving us the chance to get attached or care whatsoever about any of them. We don't care about birth or death because there is simply no build-up to any of them. And last but not least, the dragons (Title character!!!!) are just a filler, beeing there only because they have to. They take no real part in the story, they have no part in the plot, they are the same as any other ""character"": no personality, we just don't care about them. In GOT I almost cried when one the dragons was hurt and was in shock when it was brought down from the sky. If a dragon dies in HOTD, I couldn't care les..."
"Overall, very poor effort..."
"The first episode looked promising. But the show didn't get any better. The casting went so wrong. Neither the characters, nor the actors are likeable. They don't have the charm like the cast of GOT. Remember how we felt when Bran was pushed out the window and the credits started rolling in the very first episode of GOT? That feeling is missing from this. And the sudden jumps in time disrupts the flow of the story.There's no one to root for. I hope it gets better.Edit: Finally! It gave me the GOT vibe. It's funny how Westeros has the most intense weddings. Alicent's entry was so good. Looks very promishing."
"Watched 5 episodes, still awaiting for that spark ... 5th episode was promising ...with uncle and niece possibly being naughty together... then nothing happened... king father even horrified of the idea... was it not something common for the targaryens? Why being so prudish? Is out of character ...When you expect something scandalous, exciting, surprising to happen this series gives a nudge but then ... we know HOD is based on a book that is rather focused on facts and history than the GOT exciting adventures ...so far definitely reflected in the tv series ... perhaps it will improve next season, after all GOT season 1 wasn't that great, it was more of an introduction to all characters ... yet, again, many shocking things did happen (i.e. Sean bean beheading, jamie and cersei...) ...i am someone who was bitterly disappointed by GOT sudden and BADLY scripted ending, so, I am watching this new one with a bitter aftertaste still fresh in my mouth. I shall remain optimistic and give it the benefit of the doubt but I still wish HBO'd rather continued to broadcast more GOT episodes...miss the characters so much, couldn't care the less about dragons."
"It's obvious what the writers wanted in the first episode, a death, sex scenes, betrayal by a close relative, a joust with violence, and a girl who is a tom boy and a mind of her own but from a powerful family.. sound familiar? The cast is not great but the worst choice is the kings daughter. Her acting is beyond terrible! Alcocks accent changes all of the time and the last scene of ep 1 says it all.. she has just been named the successor to the king which she wanted, takes a deep breath and what, I have absolutely no idea what's she's feeling or thinking. Is she happy, relieved, vindicated as a strong intelligent woman.. I don't know because her acting absolutely sucks! So far I'm not taken with the main characters, the King is so so.. I don't hate him but I don't like him either. Nobody really stands out, even the kings brother is boring and he is supposed to be the biggest threat to the crown so far!I'm afraid the writers think by adding popular scenes and scenarios of GOT they will have a hit but it's far too obvious.. The joust is a copy of the joust in GOT where the mountain cuts his horses head off and wants to kill Tyrell.. but this joust scene was absolutely ridiculous having the protagonist killing random people who beat him in the joust. Honestly, it was stupid! Is this the crazy Targaryen trait we heard about so often.. are we to expect random craziness because the Targaryen's are insane!I was so disappointed with so much.. We briefly saw Ned Starks great grandfather who should have been cast much better and been a powerful unforgettable man who looks honourable, instead we saw a fat pathetic older man with no personality!The stories we heard of the Targaryen's in GOT especially by Shereen Baratheon and briefly by Arya talking to Tywin, described the female Targaryen's as influential powerful women but apparently they had to add woke garbage in The House of the Dragon and infer women are not respected blah blah blah.. and the last scene where she is named the successor, because the king has no sons, is supposed to make feminists happy but it just annoyed me because the story is wrong and disjointed. I honestly don't want to see causes being rammed down our throats and just want to watch dragons.I'm hoping we see dragons, dragons being born, raised and trained!Oh, when the kings wife was being cremated the daughter used the term 'dracaris' which Danaerys used! Danaerys didn't know anything about dragons, absolutely nothing.. so it makes no sense she used the same term as her ancestors used to make the dragons burn things, a term which supposedly means dragon fire. I wish they used a different term, maybe just 'fire' so Danaerys was close but not the exact word. That would have given the show more credibility and I would have thought 'wow'!It's so obvious they are desperately trying to emulate GOT and failing miserably especially with the poor cast choices! They did change some things from GOT, no handsome characters like Jaimie, no sensational actors who are dynamic and too many to mention in GOT, no likeable characters yet, but we do have annoying characters like the daughter who can't act!We will see but I'm not holding my breath! I wish viewers weren't so distracted with dragons and so desperate for another GOT and actually watched the show so their reviews were more considered because how can shows improve if we are blind to the faults!I just hope we don't see more GOT scenarios which attempt to conjure up our memory and love of GOT and we do get creative new storyline's!Ok, I'm up to ep 5 and it's getting worse! The blatant attempt to fool GOT fans and add obvious scenarios that were in GOT so we get reminded of our love for GOT is insulting! Having the princess dress as a boy and rebel is akin to Arya Stark dressing as a boy.. even the guard calling her 'boy' was annoying because it was an obvious attempt to remind us of GOT. The pre wedding dinner had to have a brutal death of course but the writers knew they could never out do the Red WEDDING because that was perfection. The backstabbing Kings HAND and the lacklustre storyline is all over the place.The princess has the audience of possible suitors and she is so useless she can't even control the suitors and leaves when they fight. A true heir to any throne would never accept such disrespect but she does! Her character is all over the place going from a nasty, self reliant young woman to one that makes excuses when confronted by her step mother when questioned about her virtue. She is neither strong nor likeable!Damon is pathetic and can apparently control horses because he gestures for his wife's horse to rear up and it does and crushes her. Then Damon gets a rock and we assume bashes her head in and again, we don't see what happens exactly the same as the crab king, who we assume he killed but didn't see!I could pick this show to bits because it's so bad and I am disappointed GOT fans are so gullible they can't see the obvious attempts to copy GOT with the same type of scenarios which proves they can't come up with anything original yet.I can't believe people are warming to any character because none of them are likeable and at this stage they could all get murdered and I wouldn't care! In fact, I wish they all did die and they started again with a better storyline and more dragons which we don't see much, the occasional dragon flying around and that's it.For a family that love dragons they certainly don't do anything with them, they don't even feed or train them, or use them.. Damon didn't even fly to the Vale to kill his wife.. so what's up with that.. who would walk or ride a horse when they had dragons.. apparently people in this show, that's who!Ok, I will be back when more episodes drop!We will see, we will see!"
"Some times we need to be angry but we dont want to hert of eny piople, than this series very good for our needly.here in iran we dont have the big serios than we like this film and the film have to many picture of urop ."
Niceties and boy are you going to before you get out there and get 3rd party to host your family and friends with us on your vacation in the next few days or two or more and more than a.
"No spoilers. Took a while to get going. I wasn't a massive fan of GoT on my first watch until The Red Wedding as it took a while to get to know all the characters. Same thing with HotD but this time there are less characters so far and it's only took until now to get going. The acting is great of course. Can be quite confusing if you're not paying attention and that's all I have to say but I need to write another one hundred and eight four characters, well it's gone down to one hundred and twenty two now. Why does a review have to be this long? No one wants spoilers so can't go into much detail."
"I can't wait for the next episodes.It gives me the same feelings as Game of Thrones, and I feel that it will be super cool.Cu siguranta va fi un serial interesant si fain de urmarit."
"It is an amazing series. It has a few nostalgic moments but It isn't Dependent On it's predecessor. It is also Good For viewers Who Are new to The Game of thrones Genre. The Writing ,VFX and Cinematography are Amazing. I love all the dragons designs But till now my Favorite has to Daemons dragon caraxes and Vhagar which they showed in the trailer. All The Actors are Phenomenal. There Is one aspect of the latest Episode which I didn't like A lot which was the sir Cristen coles character. My favorite character is Of course Daemon. I love Matt smiths performance and Younger Rhaenyra I think they shall win the Emmy."
"In the first 10 minutes everything felt so familiar from prime Game of Thrones. The casting is excellent throughout. Standout performance has got to be Matt Smith, plays the role of Daemon perfectly. Give me more!"
Yh i was a bit bored the first ep of GoT too.Its not until the multiple re-watchings after getting to know the characters that the first ep became interestingcautiously optimistic for HoD at this stage.
"I absolutely love Matt Smith as Daemon. He is doing phenomenal work on that character. He's arrogant and the bad boy that attracts the princess even though they know it's wrong, but it is what must be done. He takes the role seriously. Especially when it comes to war.The other characters in the show are just as interesting and as invested in the iron throne as well. Milly Alcock plays a ferocious young Raenyra (sorry I may have spelled it wrong) she has done a wonderful job in and bringing to her the adult age. Alicent has made herself quite comfortable sitting in the iron chair and running the show. She makes you want to hate her for protecting her children and making sure the male heir is finally put on the throne. However, not sure anymore can be hate more than Cersei.I wasn't too sure about this series, but I see now, how it definitely sets us up for GOT. So much character development, character analysis, and character comparison to GOT, as well as comparisons to the episodes. Love it!"
"So, you want to get your show noticed in 2022? Aim to be featured on the Tumblrs, Twitters, etc. Plan to have snappy dialogue delivered by attractive actors who somehow exist outside any boundaries or limitations. Make sure you have one or two jaw-dropping scenes, just enough to keep people's interest throughout the show's run.This is not a condemnation. The creators are playing to the times which embraces short term returns over a long term payoff. It's everywhere, businesses, schools, healthcare, and so on. The script has been flipped: long term planning is now seen as naive and foolish. Why wouldn't you want to maximize profits now? Why wait?But back to the show...it's visually impressive and the dragons are a highlight. Some settings adjustments were required for viewing the darker scenes, but that may be due to my TV. My first impression was noting how much the actors seemed to be ""acting."" It was like watching a local theater rehearsal with everyone wearing costumes and wigs and going over their lines.I will admit here that I really wanted to like this show as I am a fan of fantasy and welcome new additions to a sparse selection.Once I accepted the situation, even the ridiculous looking wigs on the Velaryons, I was able to get somewhat immersed in the stories. It helps that there are numerous online opportunities to fill in the gaps of information. There just isn't the depth of development that GOT had. Therefore, the Big Events didn't register as anything more than a typical jump scare. The scene in episode 8 would obviously be featured in multiple memes. And that was the point, grab the attention, then move on to the next Big Event. It's easier and more efficient than telling a story.Not that this method doesn't allow for some shining moments. The King's performance in episode 8 and the introduction of Aemond were standouts. The time jumps were jarring but necessary to preserve the focus on shocking events. Therefore, the final's big event was less fulfilling story wise because I didn't ""know"" the character. The chase was exciting and well done, and this was a pivotal moment in the overall story. It just felt like another meme created moment.I will tune in to the next season, however. According to the internet, this first season was a set up for the main story. Maybe the writers will allow some more character development? That is, if the executives allow it. So, if all that's available are crumbs of fantasy on TV, then I guess I'll dine on crumbs."
"The complete disdain the writers & showrunners have for the gift of a built-in audience is astonishing. You'll be hard pressed to find one absorbing character or captivating villain. Time is of no essence - it flows without story development; Ep 10 ends exactly as you could have predicted at Ep 1, just 17 years later. The names of so many characters sound so alike it's almost impossible to know who is being talked about - if you care - behind their backs. ""Inside the episode"" chats invariably reference things NOT in evidence in what you just watched; this 'creative' arrogance is off-putting and insulting. Even the dragons are overused yet underwhelming. GOT was kaleidoscopic, HotD is a drudgery."
"The actors are great at potraying emotions just with using their eyes. It was amazing and Iove how it feels to be in Westeros but with different set of families. The cinematography feels so medieval. I love the set of events. Casting directors were also great. I love the first 5 episodes and how they set everything up. Some people say it's so slow, and some people say it's moving too fast. For me, it was only moving like how it is supposed to, as long as the storyline is concerned. There are still many events to come and I can't wait to witness what everyone has worked hard for in the past years."
"I am very upset. I supported with ten stars because I love the series, but I am very upset. The reason for changing the actors was at the beginning. The actress was very excellent so far. This new actress is also excellent, but the change is not a good thing. There is nothing in the sixth episode that makes you attracted to watching. It was the worst episode In terms of events, and there is no soul inside the episode, it is like you drink something without taste. The sixth episode made me depressed. All the actors are excellent, but there is no soul, especially in this episode. I support the series with stars. It does not mean that I am satisfied that I love a series. I wish directors and producers to communicate with fans The old series, and I also hope that there will be opportunities in acting. I hope to get a role..."
"Last week, I binged seasons 1-7 of GoT so those episodes are still very fresh in my mind and am unaffected by rose tinted nostalgia.I've just watched episode 1 of House of the Dragon.How can I sum it up? So far, so good.The music is sufficiently different to be fresh while remaining recognizable. The production quality and cinematography are as expected - fantastic, epic and awe inspiring, aside from a couple of excessively dark scenes that were over and done with very quickly.There is gore aplenty. Nudity, vomit, sex and depravity. Incidental background humor. A promise of things to come.The casting seems to be on point - I saw no issue with any of the characters, and the leads were well chosen for their roles.The writing seems to be up to par. As an introduction, this episode was written and directed well. I want to see and know more - a good sign.So far I'm pleased with this return to the land of Westeros.Valar morghulis!"
All people rated from 1 to 7 they didnt even watch any thing ðŸ˜‚they just breaking bad fans ..first : the story so strong and have very good conection between lines second : the blood scens and the battles is so amazing the dragons cgi so good and they respect the Got fans third : the music so good and the soundtrack just amazing fourth the act is soo good enogh like rehnera and demon or feseres and anselt and others .. all of them had talent and good acting and they make trace in the hurt. And if you want to compare with (better call saul) the first season of (bcs) was good and so light not like (Hotd ) at least Hotd have so good story and charctars.
"Most of the character's are uninteresting, depressing bores with no charisma or humour. All the sub plots seem to revolve around the next pregnancy. Honestly, they can't seem to go 10 minutes before the next gory birth scene. Yeah... just so entertaining, the screaming the tears and the blood... yeah great. Gay boy blondie marries depressing girl blondie , but all her kids have black hair. Wow someone phone the Jerry Springer show.Dragons and incest"
Gory Birthing scene
"Moaning about royal dutyRinse and repeatOn the plus side, Matt Smith is great, so is the actor playing Lord Strong. Visually great, cinematography great. Just wish it wasn't so grim and dark all the time."
"Overall, this is a good show, however it is starting to seem very rushed. One of my biggest complaints is that there is not a lot of character development and I am not a fan of the time jump at all. One thing that was great about Game of Thrones is it didn't feel rushed, characters developed and grew in each episode. I was especially disappointed with the latest episode because we barely got a glimpse into Rhaenerya and Harwin Strong's relationship before he died, which is one of the plotlines so many fans were excited to see. I am hoping that the directors will create flashback scenes in future episodes because if the episodes keep feeling this rushed with no character development, then HOTD is not going to be enjoyable to watch anymore."
"I find it peculiar how the most recommended reviews are negative and trash the series (calling it a soap opera and ignoring all the political schemes and machinations) but in the meantime, if you check Amazon's Rings of Power, they are mainly positive even though the series takes its viewers as nothing but apes who need everything explained and remembered while it was able to advance in 5 hours just as much as House of the Dragon advanced in 10 minutes of one episode. Quite interesting of one might say.Anyway the series is different from GoT because it presents the story as a table of chess, continuously evolving and moving while GoT had you interested in characters and you would explore the world through them."
"The difference with GOT is remarkable. The characters are so shallow and obvious that is too boring to watch . It lacks of deepness in the general story and multiple or choral situations in the plot. The casting is weak, but has some valuable exceptions, like Matt Smith as the Prince Daemon Targaryen. I rated with a 4 and not less only for the huge invest in the locations, effects and clothing. I wish it gets better in the next eposodes but i cant figure it out how it could happen. It was a huge bet to extend the magic of the world in another show and in my opinion it was too optimistic after seeing the results, so far."
"I liked the first episode, although I'm not sure about some of the actors ability to bring what is needed for their parts. However, I am going to wait and see how it turns out at the end of S1. I am definitely NOT comparing it to GoT, because clearly, it is not the same story. It is 172 years before and a whole different family, time, setting, etc. My hope is that it will evolve and grow to be a great telling of the Targaryen family, their troubles, and what happened to the dragons in more detail. I think if people wait and see how the show progresses their opinions will change. Then again, they may just be too wrapped up in GoT that they can't remove it from the equation and see it as a stand-alone series."
"I was captured. Great new cast (can't have the same cast as before, cause their characters aren't born yet for another 700+ years). Already fell in love with the pregnant queen & already sad to see her & her son die. I understand we are building the story foundation, building characters background, I'm really looking forward to the drama ahead & can see a great potential & exploration that GoT could not have given us. We have 10 dragons to learn about now too! Can't wait to see their stories. I'm still upset about the ending of GoT, because I wanna know where that dragon went & what is going on there!! A suspense of a lifetime. Lol It was such a fantastic ending, I think we are only upset we couldn't get more & see the victories. Maybe someday we will get back to where we left off there. For now, learning how we got to ""Winter"" will be loads of fun, I believe. The quality of GoT has been captured from cinematography to costumes. I am truly looking forward to this adventure, new characters (and especially my beloved dragons) and I hope we get a phenomenal & deserving outcome this time! I'm willing & looking forward to continue watching!"
"Daemon is giving me the vibes, at least better than Got season 8. This is worth watching.A story of 172 years before game of thrones and the story line bringing the vibes back. I hope they will bring characters like cersei and Ramsay Bolton."
So far it is doing a good job at capturing the GoT style of shock/awe and bracing for the unexpected. The story also does a good job relating to the original GoT series - I hope it continues at this level.
"At last .. the rightful heir of the game of thrones is here ..The series is bloody and very, very violent and it's full of sexual scenes .. and this weakens its numbers because of that rating things ..and this is a challenge we see films and series cannot take nowadays so that they can gain more money,tickets and views .. They reduce violence, blood, or sex, and negate the nature of the world they built to get a fan children .. I see that the excessive bloodshed in this episode is a matter of respect for the inheritors of GOT .. The truth is that the best, most exciting, and funny moments of the episode are the bloodiest and the most violent partsWhatever the visual level of GOT and its greatness .. our series this time has the ability to be much better and be a cinematic reference for the ones after it.. the episode is full of wide beauty shots which is crowded and full of people and layers and creative lighting .. and it's full of great close shots .. specifically the shots of the king during his decisive decision in the middle of the episode and the montage was very effectivethe series chosen the story of the house taygerian to be the center of drama .. and that's the next big challenge .. if you remember .. the taygerian had no any presence in the Kingdom or any important position in GOT .. we only know a little of their history because of the things they told us in GOT .. so the writers had to imagine and build their life style , their look and every thing about them from zero .. they don't have a reference from GOTThe series decided to summarize the details of the beginning of the conflict in the first episode .. that sounds great at the first time .. but here comes the problem.. Unfortunately, anyone who has seen the trailers can expect the end of the episode from the first ten minutes of it and is able to anticipate its chapters.. Unfortunately, the campaign was not successful.. And the story of the episode is very redundant .. it reminds us of Hamlet and the lion king and the Northman, with different details, but I mean the story of the family conflict and the uncle's greed and the boy is role .. I think the makers noticed that so they concluded it early .. but their is a voice in my head tells me that this increases the challenge more .. because there is nothing else you can expect from watching the trailers .. but .. we will seeIt's promising, exciting,funny and got a points of power like rhythm, cinematography, the level of dialogue (not the script) and the balance between dialogue scenes and battles .. it came with many challenges..so after the great anger from GOT audience because of the last season.. there was a question: is that a goodbye? Or you're insist to take the challenge by introducing the derivative series that you are forced to reconcile with your audience with it ?.. or .. you are going to bury all that has passed due to commercial ambitions? .. and the took the challenge.. the series so far has the opportunity to be interesting .. or iconic .. or the last nail In the coffin of GOT."
"It is impossible to rate this without a comparison to GOT. In this, one has the early years of the kingdoms, with intrigue and plotting to see who will sit on the Iron Throne. It builds over the season, to a high point at the end. One has deceit, treachery, lies and determination that a Queen will never sit on the Iron Throne. Women were to provide male heirs, and often that was brutal for them. There is a lot to like in this season, but a lot will depend on what one is looking for. If one relishes the conflict and battles of GOT, this is rather sedate. There certainly is the high mark of excellence in the production, although the background information on the Blu-ray is not extensive. It is more cerebral compared to the visceral experience of GOT. Certainly a lot more dragons."
"I was never a fan of the original show, probably because I didn't like the books. This prequel on the other hand I haven't read the books and I'm enjoying it immensely.This show is showing Amazon how a fantasy show should be made.Matt Smith, Paddy Considine and Rhys Ifans are very fine actors and their ability shines through the cast in general are all doing well. The characterisations are working for me and the relationships are believable.The effects are decent, the dragons are suitably awe inspiring and the battle scene against the crab feeders troops was very effective.In all this is definitely worth watching, unlike another fantasy show just started."
"I had high expectations before I watched the 1st episode. Now after watching 6 episodes I realized how wrong I was. I feel some ppl rated it high only for the sake of GoT.The main characters are lacking complexity and the plots are soapy. Sometimes I feel it created conflicts and dramas between characters without any logic behind it. There're many scenes that didn't make any sense other than making the show more ""dramatic"". I don't feel emotionally involved. I can't love or hate any characters cuz they're too plain to be loved or hated.GoT has much more storylines overlapping but every line is well developed and interacting each other. The characters can be adorable and hateful but cohesive. In House of the Dragon, it's like a soap opera of the House Targaryen, nothing different than other soap operas.I didn't expect it to be as epic level as GoT but it's not even close. Nothing out of ordinary at all."
"A gory and impressive prequel to one of the greatest show. This is a historic tale of cruelty, inhumanity, greed, power, obsession, loyalty, hereditary, jealousy, politics, revenge and motherhood. The majority of scenes take place in castles and fortress. The first half seemed misogynistic but the second one showed the women power and has been slowly drawing the lines of the great war. The major themes of this season are the cruelty of childbirth, women as a tool to produce heirs and the succession to the Iron Throne. The CGI is awe-inspiring creating the intimidating sights of the dragons which were almost tangible. Don't miss this show because just like GOT, this is nothing short of profound storytelling, character development, heavenly visuals, sterling BGM, terrific violence, admirable production & costume design, cold wars, hunger for the Iron Throne, incest, excellent dialogues & world building."
"I know it's going to be even more DARKER, DEADILER, DANGEROUS, THRILLER, CHAOTIC, CRUEL, MERCILESS than what i am expecting.I'm already in LOVE with DAEMON and RHAENYRN.I know this world pretty well. Even I'm not safe here. We saw many dying for the IRON THRONE. This time we will see the IRON THRONE killing the one sitting on the THRONE. How exciting is this !"
"So,Ye where to begin.I didn't write a review at first episodes. I was waiting the story to unfold a bit to have an opinion.It kept me waiting for the next episode every week but i admit that at some point i lost some scenes and i wasn't interested to go back to see what happened in one or two episodes,or to watch them a second time(which was the case in Game of Thrones). Although i knew that all this was to give us the story how it will lead to what it will lead eventually.This changed dramatically at 10th and 11th episode though and i will watch those episodes several times i suppose at least until the second season.Emma Darcy and Eve Best play exceptionally good their characters and they shine in the scenes.I hope the second season won't take too long."
"I have read Fire and Blood and was because of that really looking forward to this show. I really wanted this show to be close to the book, and after watching the first episode, I can say for certain that it is. The first episode was actuelly pretty emotional what I wasn't expecting.The last scene where Viserys tells his daughter Rhaenyra a secret also left me speechless for some reason. I just really wasn't expecting that, but I loved the idea of that secret."
"I fail to find any logic on her part of not roasting everybody given the opportunity? She just escaped imprisonment! She's not stupid! She knows the endgame of all this means all her children and BELOVED grandchildren will be murdered if this coup stands. She realizes the green council has been plotting this betrayal for years! She has zero reason to believe anything they offer. There is nobody on that side she cares about. She is the Ringmaster of the Blacks! She is the matriarch of her family! There should have been some offered reason why she might be torn, like she loves somebody over there? Like she's worried about the people? She didn't mind killing hundreds of them! Hell, they stole her daughters dragon! Of course there needed to be a conflict. For the story line to continue. There could be 100 reasons. Her death comes instantly to mind! She dies trying to escape and it all makes sense. Doesn't fit? Then use one of the other 99! But to have her sit there, all battle armored up, and have her Dragon blast em with bad breath? Ridiculous!"
"I am not a lover of the original books series, therefore all the words following are only applicable to this TV series.As said, the show is an epic soap opera, it depicts the rise and down of the house of dragons. However, as a extension series of the GoT, we do hope more. Overall, despite the show depicts its characters much more complex, and sometimes overly complex, the 1st season tells only a simply story: the king made some terrible and rushed choices and then troubles followed.If you judge it as a soap opera, I would give it 9, as it is basically what GRR Martin has been writing about through all these years: family affairs decorated with some epic plots.I gave it 7/10 however, because it hardly steps even one step out of those boring and daunting family affairs. Through out the season, what we see is basically marriage after marriage and then betrayal after betrayal. It would be freshing when you first saw it, but then, you found those storys hardly different. It is always about finding a heir and no more. And, come on, it is 2022, if it is not extended from GoT, people would hardly appreciate another costume drama...More, although the eps jumps abruptly in years, and sometimes the audiences may feel divided, the pacing is actually slow and boring. The characters acts with each other for no obvious purpose and make a mess that doesn't seems to be meaningful in the end. For example, they make Daemon a good competitor for the throne in the first few eps. Then, for some reasons, he seems to be obsessed with his sister and then become a cozy husband? Again, Alicent also has unfounded motivations and few abrupt turnings of her atitude towards Rhaenyra make this character shattered as well. She loved his childhood companion and then turned away from her. Then, suddenly, the old and hardly clear-minded king said something and she become mercyful?Forgive me if I make mistakes understanding all those stories, but I all I wanted to say is that the grand plot is too simple yet the story itself is too complicated and narrowed. I hope this could be fixed in following seasons and the show could focus more on something that is beyond tiring family affairs."
"Going in to this show my expectations weren't to high, Not because of how Game of Thrones killed it during the seasons it had but mostly because of this being a story that is to good to be put on the big screen. When the show landed it first trailer my eye immediately caught how great the scenes were shot, The actors looked great in their costumes and the diversity between the actors also was really enjoyable to see. When the first episodes came to HBO and the dialogue took over the fighting scenes we expected to see it had this touch that wanted to have me see more of this dialogue between them and it delivered great throughout this whole show!, That's why it gets from me a huge 9 out of a 10 especially because of how unique they delivered the story and mostly because of how they brought their own thing in this without them copying things from Game of Thrones."
"This isn't Game Of Thrones, it's missing plenty that gave Game of Thrones it's charm. Focusing on one families petty dramas was a small part of GOT. They're riding the coattails of the name.Show doesn't deserve such a high score. I'll admit the first episode was pretty good and it probably pumped people up and inflated the score and the end of episode three was decent. But so far the boring stuff they're filling this show up with outweighs the cool stuff in some episodes. In a nutshell, it's a soap opera with dragons. If it wasn't for the design and production value in this show I wouldn't have given it a 7."
"After watching 6 episodes I find myself totally losing interest now, a bad storey line and a lack of top class actors and the fact that It jumps so many years every week is become so confusing and I find myself pausing it to work out who's who and I agree the actors are trying their best but with a bad script it's just not working. After watching Game of Thrones which for me was the best thing I've ever watched I find House of Dragon a real disappointment and it's such a shame after the wait and hype. Unfortunately unlike other people I cannot bring myself to watch any more episodes it's JUST NOT GOOD!"
"Matt Smith...nope, not right and too well known. Paddy Considine, great actor but no and no to your wig fitter. Rhyfs Ifans, only maybe but still too well known. I have high hopes that it will just take off like a slow season of Game Of Thrones."
"More interesting for me than Game of thrones. But this one is more chaotic in 10 episodes we jumped three-four times in time... It was kinda hard to remember and then understand who is who, before they got named.And of course House Of Dragons as Game Of thrones has a lot of violence scenes, porn scenes and tricky endings (like last 15 minutes in the last episode))But for sure it well-made! Mostly... I mean I have seen some bloopers and noticeable CGI but thanks for nice dragons. And of course it was not enough of them - we want more)Â£Next season must be goood) based on last episode)) and I hope it wouldn't be so chaotic."
"Did they just change every actor? Is this an alternate universe episode? Where's the bridge between that wedding party and whatever and the heck this is? Did they cut 2 seasons out between E5 & E6? I do admit the age progression between characters in the 1st 5 episodes was odd (under statement), actually weird. But this is absurd. Since nothing significant happened before the end of E5 they could've just started here and used flashbacks to explain getting here and used the characters we were becoming familiar with in the flashbacks. Now I have more questions than I did in E1. I hope E6 is just a flashforward and we get back to the story line that S1 started with. If not this is going to be to big of a pothole to stay on this road."
"What a big disappointment.The script is quite good, and the speed of the plot is ok, although sometimes it is not.The change of the actors in the middle of the session was a total disaster and hard to follow for two episodes. Some actors appear on the scene and you have to try who he/she is? To try really hard. Without hints.What happened to Dyane? Was she murdered? Then a new Dyane shows up and you cannot tell if she is the same character, if she succeded, have them her disappeared or got abortion?And how many years have passed from one episode to the next? Ugh. I could not tell.One more series destroying good books like this one, Silmarillion, Foundation ..."
"Man, they need to stop w the diminishing returns on this freakin dragon. The slow pacing of this story kills me. And the seasons end doesnt work bc you can't kill a character we have spent a total of 4 minutes getting to know and act like this is a jaw dropping season closer moment. Terrible misuse of the page's real estate. What made classic GOT work is that each character goes on an epic journey and yanks our hearts and emotioons the whole time, so when one of them dies, it feels like a real death, a real pivot to the storyline. The whole show pivots off two women who want power. For this show to work you have to be able kill ANYONE and the show still works. That is the heart of the GOT secret sauce. But in this you kill one of the two queens and show unravels instantly. Huge mistake."
"Game of Thrones or not, this show feels an unnecessary waste of time. The characters in the show have very little depth. The acting is mediocre at best, except for a couple of characters. I can't say much about the storyline as that's still evolving; however the storytelling itself is very poor quality. Most of the things that the characters say just feel uninteresting and unnecessary.The only good thing about the show so far is its imagery. There are a lot more dragons and they are more magnificent than Game of Thrones. You also get to connect a few more dots that were left for the viewers to interpret on their own in Game of Thrones regarding the larger political landscape.Overall, feels like a big waste of time."
"Â° Interesting start.Â° I'm not a fan of such girly early "" romance "". ( Atleast not for this show)Â° Please don't do NSFW stuff in this show, awkward moments I felt while watching the show with some people.. I'm here for the action and good story, not for early "" romance "".Â° The black character can remain, he looks cool and seems cool. I feel like I have seen someone similar to him somewhere else before. ( Face I mean)Â° Sometimes it felt like watching a show that has some goals in mind. ( Like "" let's make people believe in something and then crush it with a good reason so that the next throne person will be allowed/loved to see them sit on the throne. ""Â° Such cruelty i didn't expect. But it was a good strategy in some way, hard to describe, I'm not a fan of that, but I must be sincere, sometimes a king or high rank must do what's best for the greater good. I still don't support it though.Â° Some of the battles were hard to follow, I don't know if it's just me, but sometimes it felt like not seeing people hitting someone. I don't know how to explain this, not a big deal for now since it's early, but thought of writing some of my current thoughts about this.Â° Decisions are hard, i maybe wouldn't do that decision related to the king and baby.Â° The story seems interesting.Â° The graphics are great. ( Not always though)Â° The dragon is maybe one of my favorites of this episode.Â° I hope to see a good character development for the prince. Sometimes it felt like the goal was to make people hate the prince and love the princess.Â° *The face of the princess I kinda don't like. I wish it was someone that looked like Emma Watson from beauty and the beast. Or Keira Knightley, Eliza Taylor, etc.Â° The armour of the prince is cool.Â° If I see someone like John snow in this show I might like it more, for now I don't have super favorites, but yea, it's the start, maybe things become even better later, who knows.Â° Near the end i wasn't much excited for the next episode.Â° I almost wanted to not watch a scene when I saw some specific "" blood "".Â° I like that the duration is not short for this episode.Â° The talk is was kinda boring to me, I don't remember much about the talk though. ( At the table)Â° Brother to Brother was exciting to watch, made me wonder if later a betrayal will happen. ( Maybe one of them wanting to sabotage the unexpected in future episodes? )Â° I give this episode a 3 out of 5. But has potential to be something more.Â° If you're into cruel action you might like something.Â° I might have seen some people that might be part of lgtbq movements irl...Â° One female elder close to the family above the 70+ was happy about the princess.. I wonder if they would like Winx club(but then again, I used to watch that and liked it. )Â° *That princess does have strong qualities even though I'm no fan of her face. I like a lot more the one in the future game of thrones. ( If comparing face. )Â° I was a little disappointed when I realized who the "" money person "" / coin master was, I had hoped that the coin master was not a coin master but someone more important. Interesting living being though.Â° Sometimes it felt that this show( first ep) was more for the softer side of people ( the feminine type) But sometimes also for the "" cruel "" types."
"Okay, tbh i come to review it after a whole damn month after watching me. Because it is so captivating that i am thinking when would next episode and series s2 come.Still thinking about rhenera and all that"
"Pleasee excuse me for not writing the names and review properly cuz watching it a month ago but came to review as it is my duty and i am what still thinking about it!!??? BruhhSo the thing which i hated the most and most is the names of people. There was really no any reference and how they just keep popping new and difficult names. It was so hard. I was keep staring at the subtitles. It was so so so difficult to understand the episodes and remember the named that everytime i need to go to google for an explanation for that episode on my native language.Trust me it was so hard that i was so Frustated that i began to cry. But i loved the story, now i wanted to understand the story, is it going as i want. Bruhhh so hard work i need to do for the series"
"For eg, for the first episode, i i i legit watched the first 4 mins of Series for like 20 times. Because i didn't understand! I mean two girls was having the same name. Rhenera, Rheanyra. Only the difference of 'y' was that. I actually thought it was going to be the story of wife of lorn cornwollis(if not wrong) i mean the daughter and not some nephew's kid. And by god, i wasted my whole day googling the family tree and getting all the spoilers for GOT! Myy god fr. I knew that the brothers marries sister and i totally got my eyes on GOT! Wow. And now i knew and then started watching it.There are many a things in each episode i dislike but let's save it for next season.Another remarkable thing was between ser and rhenera. That cum i got wow. Watched like 6 times. It was so great. Also deamon was daddy. Loved it and raised guy's expectations. Her uncle was soo down to earth when got married. Oh wow and that respect for queen. Sheer goosebumps. And dragon. Also the time period moving was legit soo fast lol. Means after 1 episode u go ahead 15-20 years. So fast series i mean"
Definitely up for GOT
"But that dedication for 8 seasons and 10 episodes for each, may god help me."
"Why would you have a build-up for 5 episodes, get us invested into a lot of things just to take them away and have an anti-climatic time-jump and a major recast of the main actors? Not to mention you build-up new characters the entire episode just to kill them at the end. Could have just told us about it for the same emotional impact, because we were not invested. The new cast is incredibly different acting-wise and the way the time-jump was handled was weird. My friend asked non-stop for the first 10 minutes who the new characters are. Hugely disappointed to the point where the show completely lost my interest."
Paddy Considine is certainly a great actor but his performance as the king is off the mark and hurts the Show! Can someone please start working with him and make him better? The show has a great and balanced cast so I really don't get why the let him go wild! The show itself is so well executed and well written that I think it deserves a better lead! I am sure he can come around if the directing is clear! Other than that all the departments doing a great job and I am intrigued! That was actually all I wanted to say but now IMDB wants to write more then 600 characters so continue writing so they let me release this review!
"Game of Thrones, minus the last season, was one of my favorite shows and House of the Dragon tells the story of the House of Targaryen's decline, and with it the decline of the Valyrians, and although it is not as grand and epic as Game of Thrones, it is quite good.However, the reason for my lower score, is that the series takes several liberties with the characters. It does something that sadly a lot of Hollywood productions does these days. It changes it for ""modern"" audiences, despite the book written by GRRM, Fire and Blood, being released in 2018.One of the major changes is that it turns most of the male characters to be either outright evil, stupid or weak. Aegon II is pictured as a weak, useless, w***-monger where as he in the book, not being a saint, actually contested being crowned, claiming that Rhaenyra was the rightful heir. In the show it shows him not wanting to ascend the Iron Throne because he is a useless coward.More over he was not the puppet, being portrayed in the show, but took several actions, including offering the truce to Rhaenyra where as in the show it was shown as Alicent doing so.This leads me to Alicent who in the show is shown to be moral and upright and only by mistakenly hearing Viserys name Aegon his heir, challenged Rhaenyra's right to the throne. In the books she did so in cool and calculated way because of her self-ambition and that of her own children.Finally the other Valyrian house, house Valeryon, where strangely depicted as being black with blonde hair, which just looks weird, where as in the books they have the same Valyryan traits as the Targaryen, meaning golden/silver hair and purple eyes.So basically the show makes the whole story to be centered around Queen Rhaenyra and Alicent and minimizes the roles of rest of the cast which does disservice to the source material and that is sadly all too common these days."
"Extremely disappointed. I sit and watch it each week with anticipation of something good might happen. It only gets worse. Game of thrones was incredible. I did not expect the same thing, but I thought it would be somewhat as good. It's terrible. I will finish it because I'm 6 episodes in. It reminds me of dark shadows from the 70s. Although it's not as good as dark shadows. Hopefully the director will read some of these reviews and change some things. It seems like they are trying to get us to buy into high drama so far. Like daytime soaps. Oh well. That's my rant. I will rewatch game of thrones till then."
For all people finding pace slow or fast remember that this is only 1 chapter in the book..you have to wait till the fight began.. till then its all about the kids and their dragons.. real thing is the fight and thats it and nothing else..the drama is not that interesting than GoT because it doesnt have that many characters and houses..remember this entire series is just dance of dragons which is 90% targaryen so the show has to focus on only them..i personally think it could have been much better..the stepstones battle was pathetic. Nothing like any of the GOT battles that had excellent background scores as well...i really like the Velaryon house background music..that is nice.
"Much like its predecessor, the CGI is great, with wonderful costumes, and fascinating characters. One thing I appreciate is the character development. I have switched sides several times rooting for Alicent then something will occur then I find myself rooting for Rhaeynera. Both women and their families are complex. I loathe and love Dameon similtaneously. Very well written. The dragons look amazing and are well used in the story. Now for the bad. The story is a little slow and can use more action sequences and shock factor. Despite this, it is setting up a solid foundation and I look forward for the seasons to come."
"If it is not under the name ""Game of Thrones"", I would probably stop watching it after the first two episodes and think, okay this sort of soap opera is probably not for me. Yet this one calls itself a prequel of GoT, so I've been hoping it would get better on the next episode and watched until Episode 6 when I realize it's not going to get any better.Game of Thrones is considered a great series for the marvelous scenes, the complex yet reasonable plot, deep characters, and so many other rare qualities. This one has none. Except for the first episode, which I thought was not bad, this series has only about seven or eight recognizable characters, and 90% of the time is just verbose conversations, about the one topic: who to marry and how to birth a child. The other 10% of the time? Childbirth scenes. In addition to the absurd topic, the characters in the series have no consistency at all, changing characteristics with no justification. Not to mention the obvious loopholes in the plot. It seems to me that the creators of this series care nothing about the setting and spirit of the Game of Thrones World. Just plug in some familiar names, get some medieval costumes, and fans would be so excited and watch whatever mess is underneath, right?Shame on whoever creates this one."
"After watching GOT, my expectations were high, but this series seriously lacks portraying the variations of emotion, lust, greed, anger, frustration, grief, fear, power etc and complexity of characters. Progression of characters is much lighter, making it dull affair in between. A steong story buildup is missing, which was the strength of GOT. I think the on-screen time being given for few characters is too short, killing of Strong family could have been portrayed better. Character build up lacks the spice overall, which deprives it of complexity i had expected. The visuals are okay but not better than GOT. Still, it is worth watching and i seriously hope the plot will grow even more interesting with the next few episodes. The dragon visuals shown are also good and the fight scenes of Daemon with his dragon were the best so far."
"Well, Sapochnik knows how to direct, he's great as a matter of fact, as long as he's got good staff around him. However, Game of Thrones will forever define him. Whether he likes it or not. It still blows my mind how Miguel could have directed a masterpiece like episode 8 of season 5: Hardhome, then make the mistake of not screening something like season 8's The Long Night. Just compare both episodes, the best to the worst. Anyway, belonging to the heartbroken GoT victims..I mean..former fans, House of the Dragon is good not great, yet. But it kind of, sorta fills a great void left by Dumb & Dumber. Sorry, David & D. B..(not sorry!)"
"There are some great things about the show. Like dragons glore, familiar sword play, and great evil villians. Talented actors like Paddy Considine, Rhys Ifans and Matt Smith..all excellent. And actresses, Olivia Cooke, underrated for sure. And Milly Alcock, who's a ringer for a young Carly Simon (hint, hint..life story there..call it, ""Clouds in my Coffee."") But, it doesn't have the magic GoT once had, at least through the first 5 seasons anyway. GoT had a raw, visceral emotion that will certainly never be matched, or most likely seen again. House of the Dragon is political, not as sexy or mysterious but it's got the potential to be above average. I'll keep watching. With my guard up, for now."
"It is impossible to find the script, cast and CGI of Got in this series. Dialogues are very shallow and boring. The characters cannot connect the audience to themselves. I'm not curious about the fate of any character right now. Boring scenes with the same themes, always in the same place. The constant elaboration of who will be the heir pulls the series down. I don't expect it to be as good as Got, but I would still expect it to be a series suitable for this universe. It was one of the series that I was not curious about the next episode. I think I wasted my time watching the show. Absolutely disappointing."
"Review of Season One:As a GAME OF THRONES fan who even enjoyed the much-lamented final season, I was understandably eager to check out this prequel series. Sadly, HOUSE OF THE DRAGON turns out to be a far cry from the success of the original, a follow-up that seems more than content to emulate rather than innovate. Right from the first episode we're back into a world of backbiting, jousting and incest, all of it feeling very familiar from the original show. The actors are well chosen for their roles (although I was unsure about Considine) but this series is particularly slow-moving and I didn't find it engrossing until episode seven, when things finally start picking up. The CGI effects are okay but overly familiar from GOT; the dragons have lost their magic touch. I hope the next season improves..."
"The writers and directors of the House of Dragon really understand what made Game of Thrones tick, and as such, they've heaped together remakes of all the best bits into the premiere episode.A corrupt kingdom falling apart? Definitely. Dragons? Yep. Gory tournaments? You got it. Pointless violence? Absolutely. A bit of T&A here and there? Oh la la.... and it still manages to surprise with a scene that will force any woman who has even given birth to switch off half way through the first episode.The problem is that the first episode breaks the fourth wall by being a little bit too obvious about what it is setting out to do - and to be fair - it's going to struggle to do it's own thing. More of the same thing isn't bad, but what House of Dragon is lacking so far is good characterizations and pacing to go with it. We don't understand the characters or their relationships that well before they're already doing things we don't comprehend. It just makes the pace feel a bit rushed with so much happening. Maybe it will all make a bit more sense later, but then -- well it's early days -- it might not either."
"This is the whiners version of GoT. There are no standout characters, there are no standout bad guys or good guys. There is a cast of characters that are tedious, nondescript and just plain boring. Even the dragons are boring. How can you make a dragon boring? I could have taken it for 2 episodes, or even 3 episodes IF it had finally clicked and gotten going but it simply refuses to turn into a compelling drama. As exciting as Game of Thrones was this is its poor, boring little brother. That I made it through 6 episodes is a testament to just how great GoT was. If this were anywhere near that I'd have finished the season. I will not even bother to watch episode 7 or 8."
"The show is good, characters are well picked and fit well into their characters, battle scenes are great, dragons are impressive and the setting is really on GoT par.Only thing it is lack is context and immersiveness. Each scene is only about the main characters, betrayal and other tensions between them, there are no context scenes that made Game of Thrones such a superb show. We have few scenes of how the cities looked, common problems, secondary character plots/developments, etc. We only got some scenes of other cities main halls and that's it, I still have no idea how Driftmark looks and feels, we only saw the fireplace 3 times. And above all, the once every 2 episode time skip is a mess. I understand that they wanted to fastforward the action scenes and plots, but skipping in time for 3-6 years makes the viewer unable to relate to any main character and emphasize with them."
Wasn't expecting many similarities to GoT (s1-6) but i have noticed there are some shock value scenes you can see have been put in to mirror's it's predecessor. While it makes sense being the same world the filming of it just feels a bit off & if it wasn't for this scene I'd probably give it an 8.These scenes can easily be skipped over in about 2 minutes and I'm actually enjoying the rest of the story unfold and how they are honouring the past series in other ways.It's nice to have a piece of entertainment that you can sit back and enjoy that is not trying to ruin it predecessor like recent Amazon and Disney productions.Even with the time jumps it is not confusing and I cannot wait to watch the rest!
"They try so hard to show you who the character were as their younger selves they lose any semblance of a plot. Honestly the lord of the rings one on Amazon is much better, don't know what the rating is so high for this soap opera.One thing that is good about this show is it may well be ending soon because I can't see it getting another series in this state.Give me an hour and a few vague memories of the original series's and I could probbaly put together some better storytelling that this effort. No drama. No love for the project and totally boring. I'm on episode 7 and sometimes I forget what I've even watched. It's literally chewing gum for the brain, living off the brand that worked so hard to create it."
"Superb performances by Matt Smith, Paddy Considine and Bill Paterson. However there are some truly dreadful displays from far too many actors in this show. They lack gravitas and stumble over their lines and take one out of the scene. I have no idea what happened here. Surely the director should have got weak performers to redub their lines? This is very much an inferior version of Game of Thrones. It is the Scrappy Doo to Scooby Do. I wasted far too many hours on this waiting for it to start for it to only meander with only the odd blip. Game of Thrones at its best set the bar very high but this series does not even come close."
"I know everyone hated GOT's last season of the series but up to season 6 it was a groundbreaking and fantastic series. As much as I'd like to love this prequel, it's not anywhere near as great as GOT. The dialogue is flat, special effects mediocre, the story line is dull and the acting falls flat on dull dialogue.David Benioff and DB Weiss were a far superior writing and creative team. As much as I like Miguel's direction in GOT, it's not doing it for me with House of Dragon. I'll keep watching but my expectation's are much lower. There also seems to be gratuitous violence in the show. It's not needed. I really hope that the Addison of Alan Taylor will help the show."
"The pace is skincrawling slow. It's extremely boring and only has 2 actors with chops in the whole show so far,and even those are marginal. I'm done with this series.Gotta love when producers make a garbage no-effort spin off of a masterpiece for the sake of money alone. This is a futile attempt to funnel money off the popularity of GoT.You'll never convince me the rating on this isn't manufactured with bots etc. Read the reviews from actual humans. This show is not rated 8.7 in any sane universe. More like 3.7. I think I'll let this roll for a few seasons before even attempting another episode."
Really good start! Enjoyable
"All the ambience of game of throne is here.The CGI is kind of Inconsistent for the ambition of the show, but its ok the VFX artist job is not easy nowadays...."
"The story is interesting and we get attached really fast to the characters its cool and intuitive.And the cast is so good every actor! The costumes and the environment are well done.It re-gave me some hope in HBO after the disaster of the last season of GOT with a draft as a script like a pilot season, after a story this long having an ending this short.....But anyway the House of the dragon is THE show évent every week like old good Time the hype is Increasing !!"
Besides obvious push toward certain culture they were filling plot gaps with unnecessary violence and sex scenes which wouldn't be needed if plot would be better.Maybe next episode will be better with something to remember...
"Already destroyed got ending. And now destroying its legacy 😐. Stop. Just stop. Stop producing such shows in an era where we keep getting stupid worthless series every now and then. Be it any marvel series or hbo series or any movie... I have to say that directors fail to provide something new. All those years, all those cliches. Same thing over and over again. Well. I hear from others also the same thing. That... Does hotd even have a story? Do directors even know what they are doing? I mean, what is this? Some kind of joke. Its such a bad waste of money. Better stop. Don't continue shows lile euphoria and hotd, etc."
"Considering how horribly disappointing the final season of Game of Thrones was, I'm shocked I actually ended up watching House of the Dragon. Since it's a finished work though and the two incompetent people to blame for the mess that was GoT's final season are not involved, I gave it a chance. I was hoping it would remove some of the bad feelings GoT's ending left me with. And it did... as long as I don't think about how 90% of what we saw on GoT had no purpose really and most things left unanswered.Then it hit me, the pure genius of such a terrible last season of Game of Thrones... it makes everything GoT related better by comparison. Honestly, I probably would be more critical of HotD if GoT had a well-written final season.I'm giving 6/10 because season one was definitely a good story and worth watching but not sure if it's because the bar has been set so low for GoT fans who hated the final season. I'm not willing to give them my trust for the full series just yet. If season 2 holds up, I'll update."
"""Of all difficulties which impede the progress of thought, and the formation of well-grounded opinions on life and social arrangements, the greatest is now the unspeakable ignorance and inattention of mankind in respect to the influences which form human character."" (J. S Mill)"
"Children will watch this because of cool battles and cool dragons, it is easy to get it online without paying.Boys will make misogynistic memes and girls will laugh at them with them. The realm had never seen a female ruler, the realm had never experienced a female ruler, yet the realm did not want a female ruler despite all the wars, rape and dismemberment of bodies and ethics the realms of men proved to experience. The serverly irrational dehumanization of women, which women take part in, bequeathing the slavery unto their daughters after being made a human chattle themselves by systemized, traditionalist philosophy of men. Rhaenyra said ""when i am queen i would make new rules."" To the old queen ""men will put the realm to the torch than see a woman ascend the iron throne"" speaks alot about our history. ""Violently they (men) hate the discerning ones"" (Nietzsche). This series like thrones will be to some extend realistic, just as the real world history which constructed women was flawed, this one is too. But children and teens should not be able to watch this stuff easily (being *the influences which form the subsequent character, which is always negative). There is no parental permission required, just like pornographic sites you just have to lie you're of age. Please keep this away from your children. And understand ""the ruler must have a sound mind, a cock is not necessary (Alyssane)"". Even male authors can feel the real spirit of feminity, in their unconscious contrasts and antithesises of masculinity."
Shocking scenes just for shock value and not adding to the story line. Obviously not the same crew or production quality.Will sit the rest of this series out.
"It's ok, but being the same style in almost every aspect as Game of Thrones, it appeals mostly to hard core fans. I would have liked it to be different i.e. Not repeat the same topics (incest, gore, dragons...), but I understand it couldn't, being in the same fantasy world. George is a great writer and great writers can be also versatile, meaning they would be able to switch style without much loss in quality. That being said, and me being a GOT fan, I like it because it brings back that world which I have missed. I would have also preferred that Milly Alcock would continue being Rhaenyra, not that Emma D'Arcy isn't good, she is a great actress, but the switch is jarring. I also don't know where they intend to go with the show, if it follows exactly the original (history) book it is based on, it will span many centuries and therefore there would be a risk of dilution - being attached to the characters/actors in a series is an essential ingredient for its success with viewers, not having that is a risk of the viewers giving up too early on it, after their beloved characters leave the show (creators have certainly known that and read the many psychology articles describing the phenomenon, so I hope they would be careful)."
"I never got the hype about GoT because it wasn't a superseries for me either.These 6 episodes are basically just what you already know. Only with new story and new characters. If you look at it neutrally,"
it's a good fantasy series that has its hype thanks to GoT.
"The only reason why this program is so popular is becau8se it comes on the back of GOT. In my opinion the stories are disjointed and difficult to follow in any sort of linear way. Character development is missing. I do not get a solid sense of any of the characters, unlike GOT. And worst of all, it took me a half hour to realize that many main characters all of a sudden, , without warning, grew up by years between episodes 5 and 6. Any, affinity, as little as it may have been, for some of the main characters is totally emptied by this switch to older actors who only minimally look like their younger selves. Truly disappointing after an incredible production like GOT."
"I feel that I am watching this show only to get some taste of GoT, starting with the theme song.This show is not letting us get connected to the characters at all. In GoT every Stark Kid, Tommen, Marcella, and even older characters grew with time. But here we are constantly getting not single but multiple new characters every other episode, and they are dying like flies.Daemon looked promising, but after he killed Crab feeder, not much is happening with him either. And I feel we are getting an overdose of dragons in this show.I will watch this show, but till episode 8, I don't think it will get cult status like GoT. I hope the makers prove me wrong."
"Have seen the first 5 episodes and believe me it is nothing like the Game of Thrones, no grandeur, no powerful Star cast ( except 2 or 3 stars). Characters are all forgetful and now they even did a 10-15 yr time jump and replaced most of the characters after 5 episodes. I really hope the series picks up in later episodes.Honestly it gives me nothing to be waiting for every Sunday night. If it was not a prequel of GOT, no one would be watching it. Except episode 2, it has been very dull And slow. Right now, this is still better than the Rings of Power but no way matches the level of Game of Thrones."
"HBO apparently. How ridiculous to take a.vivacious heroine and replace her with a lackluster Sursi want to be. Up to this point in the show I found myself rooting for the Raynaera character, but this poorly substituted charlatan. I find myself looking forward to her demise. Another HBO flop. Why they hadn't just chosen to age the character that had already stolen the hearts of the viewer with her grit and fire is beyond my understanding, and I'm sure of the many fans who had the painful job of watching the episode. I was twenty minutes into the show before I realized the hag giving birth was supposedly the Princess Raynaera. HBO deserves the disaster."
"Nice swords and sorcery prequel continuum (after one episode) that has the same good feeling and quality as the original. Paddy Considine and the majority of the cast lend it weight, however (as a grown up) this is the first thing I've watched Matt Smith in and, eeek, he is really not good at acting - one of those folk that make ya wonder 'why didnae I go try it, if this is the kinda BS they'll cast in major productions?!' not just just bad, but unattractive, incompetent and downright laughable in every aspect. I really hope I'm not put off the entire series due to having to swallow the nonsense that is Matt Smith, eurgh. Always found it weird he was 'famous' but figured he must be a decent actor or charismatic enough to carry it off - nah.... must be nepotism or fellatio that got the career coz even with all the money, production and editing he's still a honking big embarrassment in this first ep. I've not read the books but I've a horrible feeling he's not going anywhere either."
Like many I approached this prequel with some trepidation and with an open mind.The issues for me are:
"1) Same plot as the original GOT. A flawed but decent enough king is totally blind to the naked and raw ambition of close family members despite trusted advisers warning him about it. The evil character then acts in an evil manner but hey, it's ignored because....plot.2) Poor casting. The King, the Matt Smith character and the daughter just don't have what it takes. Matt Smith is particularly bad. He's supposed to be malevolent but his voice is high pitched and in some scenes he comes across as a petulant schoolboy. The King has no gravitas whatsoever and the daughter is your normal young performer that isn't very good at acting.3) Dodgy CGI-it looks very fake sometimes.4) The daughter has all the hallmarks of a Mary Sue. Time will tell but I don't think I'm going to be proved wrong."
"... Seriously guys and gals, writers and producers , could you not have come up with something better than this ? After having soo much inspiration at your hands with GOT , all that you could muster was this lame of a show with no chemistry between any of the characters and absolutely no engaging plot or even conversation ?? So sad...you had to change the actors from bad to worse in the middle of the episodes...and to top it all we see that all shows lately insist with this bizarre ""progressive "" casting which gives zero justice to the history of our world !!!! In the name of decency and common sense, really, we can be inclusive and present a myriad of other stories where there will be no need to alter history and present lies to the unsuspecting new generation! There is plenty of room for progressive and inclusion but let s be decent and respect the reality of past times !!!!!!! Disgustingly manipulative world we came to live in... sad sad sad !!!"
"I´m speechles how bad this show is - 5 episodes in, and I´m about to give up watching. There is just none of the magic that GOT had. If you take away the occasional dragons, this show seems more like a medieval ""Dynasty"" soap opera. None of the characters are really interesting, the actors are struggling with their cheesy lines. Milly Alcock is so obviously put in as a ""Daenerys 2.0"", and Matt Smith is overacting the hell out of the bad guy.What is missing? I think the supernatural threat that affected all parties in GOT was a driving element of the series together with the phenomenal character development and the mixture of archetypes (the heroes, the anti heroes, the victims and culprits).So many different storylines developing seperately and coming together inevitably in a huge world right from the first episode in GOT, while HOTD focuses only on the Tagaryen family and who´s going to be the heir of the Iron Throne.What a waste of money and time."
"I am shocked by the high reviews here. Truly stunned. The show is so bad it might as well be a parody. The acting is an abomination! These actors aren't even in the same league as the GOT actors. It's so bad it's laughable!! The casting is some of the worst i've ever seen in any show/movie - ever.Too much wokeness here too. Sorry but it's true. Doesnt follow the original story at all. It's so obvious, so forced, so infantile. It's a joke...The writing is pathetic, it's 2022 and the way it's shot doesnt look half as good as GOT. Anyone who likes this garbage shouldn't dare call themselves GOT fans.This show is a disgrace."
"Extremely boring. Nothing comparable with GOT. I think the storyline is ok but I was expecting more action. GOT used to have me on the edge of my seat. I actually dozed off when I was watching episode 4! Maybe it's a slow burner, a VERY slow burner. I will carry on watching in the hope it improves but so far I am far from impressed. Matt Smith is not a believable character ... he's very much public school boy and makes for a pretty poor villain/hard man. I think the casting is very poor and I'm struggling to relate to any of the characters. I've been very excited about this spin off but I feel very let down!"
"Well after watching House of the Dragon out of boredom, I can officially give it a 2/10. How are you going to skip through 15 or so years and have about 3 things happen. The should rename the show, ""house of the 1 guy that slowly turns into a zombie and dies"" I really don't understand the unnecessary actor switch either, especially if it was done out of choice. The only somewhat likeable character is Damon, but even he is cartoonish at best. What an absolute let down, I have no hope for the future of this show. After all that is said, at least there's about 32 seconds of action in the whole 1st season."
"If I could give this a -10 rating I would. The writers, producers and directors of House of the Dragon need to go back and watch the first 3 episodes of GoT. They need to be reminded of what makes a great series, what gets people engaged and invested in the characters and what keeps them coming back for more. I'm shocked that anyone involved in the making of House of the Dragon can look at this and think ""yes this is good"". The characters are boring, the scenery is dull and the writing even duller.HBO would have been better off making a completely different series based on some other fantasy novel.The only reason I can come up with that it's so bad is that they wanted to save $$$$ and figured people will watch because it's a prequel to GoT. I'm pretty positive any rating over 6 is someone who either works for HBO or is related to someone who works for them.HBO, please do us a favor and DO NOT give us a Season 2. Instead put your energies into creating a good series. It doesn't have to be great series, no one expected something as great as GoT, we just expected it to be semi-good. You couldn't even manage that ... so disappointing."
"Currently up to S1Ep7 and it feels every bit BBC and not HBO. Graphics is poor in parts. Lot of chit chat and nothing happening. Acting is sub standard. Characters are meh, like no one I like, no one I hate. Slow as anything.Not feeling this and to say fans hated season 8 of GoT that was significantly better than S1 of this.Young Rhaenyra Targaryen is the only decent thing in this. Visery's can't act for toffee.Shows the difference between GoT and HotD, Sean Bean was the main guy compared to the dude out of Dr Who.I don't know whether to carry on watching this or not. Already know 3 people that gave up on it, might follow suit."
"If this is what a top tier budget and HBO gets you these days i have very little faith in the future of high production TV-series. British soap operas from the 70's offer more well developed characters and storylines.How did they actually clear this script? It's been many years since i actually quit an episode halfway through by pure boredom but this is exactly what happened watching House of the Dragon.Three episodes in and all we've been offered so far is ramblings of a king who should marry his daughter. Stepstones. Stepstones, Stepstones, and some ugly crab dude (Who even comes up witht this crap?).The dialog is unbearably boring and repetitive. The action scenes are predictable with zero tension. The acting is at best acceptable but the characters are incredibly shallow and unlikable. If the main cast disappears in the next episode i won't even care.How people can rate this 8+ is beyond me. What happened to you? This is a stain on the GOT universe."
"Not possible to avoid comparison with Game Of Thrones - and this one has no development, they plot conflicts out of nowhere, everything happens with no reason or whatsoever.Very poor work offered because they know people will watch anyway. No attention to the characters constructions, the time passes and the actors do not carry particularities to connect with the same standard with the past. In general the phography is good and the construction well done, just seems that they are not willing to give you something with the same standard of complications we had in Game of thrones at first.To summarize, this one does not carry the same level at all."
"I only watched the first episode and couldn't be bothered to finish it. What is the point if I even can't see what is happening on screen?I didn't even have to guess that the cinematographer of this episode was Fabian Wagner, the same guy who shot the battle of Winterfell in the last season of Game of Thrones. It is the same use of day-for-night underexposed muddled mess of greyish brown nuances. Don't modern cinematographers learn anything about contrast anymore?After his failure in the battle of Winterfell I listened to the smug comments made by Wagner et al. About how the consumers who watch this show know nothing about proper calibration of their televisions and only watch content on the phones and iPads. Well, as it happens, I have worked as an AV-technician so I have watched both shows on a well-calibrated 65 inch OLED screen in a room with blackout curtains, and it still looks like garbage.Their next excuse is that streaming compresses the image resulting in a loss of picture quality, and that the image is completely different when you watch it on blu-ray or a 4k disc.I'm sorry, but how do you think most consumers view your product? In other words, you don't care about streaming consumers. Who do you think you're making this product for? Talk about a big middle finger right in our faces. Again, as it do happens, I have watched the Game of Thrones on blu-ray on the same setup, and the change in image quality is miniscule.It's time for smug hack Wagner to take lessons from real cinematographers who are known for dark cinematography but understand the necessity of contrast, like Gordon Willis or Darius Khondji.Not watching the rest."
"I know I shouldn't judge this against GOT as it is a different show. How can you not though!Zero character development. The story is so lacking they have to jump 10 years and still nothing interesting is happening! There is so little intrigue, no inter nation politics, one very boring storyline. I assume the people who wrote this never watched game of thrones. There was more excitement in the first episode of season one of game of thrones than there has been in all episodes for house of dragons. Why?Just get rid of it. Start anew. Build a new story around the events post GOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Be warned, it's by no means GOT, it's just a boring soap opera with characters wearing GOT costumes. I forced myself to watch this until episode 6 but couldn't stand it any longer. Fans of classic soap operas (the brazil ones) might be okay with this. Breeders might also be enjoyed (since it features some babies and stuff) but for real GOT fans this is pure HORROR.Some of the CGI created backdrops look quite good but this does not hide the fact that there is absolutely no tension, to epic characters, no good storytelling, no sudden turns or anything else a GOT sequel should have. It's a deadborn child."
"Everyone is awful, and the writers seem determined to make each week more awful than the last. By this point, I don't care about any of the characters. I don't want any of them to succeed, and I'm also not particularly interested in whatever stomach-churning way the show has devised to make them fail or betray one another. By Episode 6, even Matt Smith has lost his luster. Defenders of the show may claim that such hateful backstabbing is ""realistic,"" but medieval political intrigue has been done better before. This show is built on shock-value and violence alone, without any emotional core for viewers to care about."
"A TV show suitable for today, trying to be edgy yet diverse. Trying not to offend but create drama. Just rubbish TV as expected for today's market. Poor acting and questionable casting all round. They try and shock with ""gruesome"" scenes rather than just write a decent story. This was such a disappointment given the success of Game of Thrones, although I should have seen it coming given how GoT finished. Don't bother watching you'll just be let down. I do believe they could have had more diversity with the dragons though, as it doesn't state what colour they are in the books, I really questioned why there wasn't any pink or green or blue dragons."
I'm such a big fan of game of thrones. Even to the point that I was not disappointed in the ending. I was so looking forward to house of dragons but so far I'm a bit disappointed. Overall it's all been kind of dull in every way. Is the cinematography different? I can't really put my finger on it. Not even blown away with the dragons. Why are they now so lack luster? Before when they were in a scene I could vividly imagine riding one. I could see every scale. Also the characters don't pop. With GOT I instantly felt a connection with the characters. I literally wanted to reach through the screen and slap the evil ones. I adored so many others instantly. Then there were the ones I hated at times but also felt empathy towards. The parts were so well defined. So far I really don't feel a whole lot towards anyone on the show. Is it just realllyyyy sllooowwww? I'm often a little board watching. I hated to type that but it's true. I'm going to keep watching. I'm super hopeful that some kind of intensity builds up. That I'm engaged with the characters. That I can't wait for the next episode to air but so far I am a bit let down.
"I tried so hard to like this. From the start, it looked like a cheap imitation of GoT. From the special effects, to the acting to the plot, it just wasn't good. It had promise and there were some good nuggets of acting/plot in there, but overall it was confusing. A fight breaks out during a big event then it cuts to several years later without us knowing why the fight happened. It felt very rushed. I really enjoyed how they did the throne though. That was missing from the original show. The diversity casting that others complained about was done well I thought. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get into any of the characters. By episode 6 I realized I didn't feel invested in any of them."
"Y'all come on, this is so dang boring. The few snips of dragons or a battle is GREAT, but the vast majority is the squabbling/politics of unlikable characters. Not to be confused with so unlikable you love to hate them like in GOT. They will take 4 long drawn out episodes to say these 2 teenage girls that use to be BFF's now hate each other. BFD. Thank goodness for Matt Smith, he is the only reason I keep watching, his acting and character are exactly what I expected. He is currently carrying the show. The actors are not terrible, they're doing what they can with what they have-it is the writing. It's way too predictable, not in a good way or a classic way, in a way that could've been wrapped up in one episode they create 6 episodes instead. Come one! Let's GO."
"I never expected this to be like GoT. I read Fire and Blood and it's pretty dry. More like a history lesson than a grand adventure. It still fell short of expectations.The pacing vacillated wildly between too meandering or plodding, and huge, jarring time skips that yank the audience out of what little connection we may have made with plot and characters.We did not need 8 episodes of Viserys ruling like a sack of boiled potatoes and repeated exposition to tell the audience that this family and their hangers-on are terminally ambitious and will go to war when Viserys dies. I like slow burning stories, intrigue, and character development, my criticism isn't about the lack of action at all- if the characters or conflict was compelling, taking time to focus on the slow moments and details pays off. Nothing interesting was happening, there was no humor, no enduring loves or friendship, everyone's either an ascetic or a hedonist and almost everyone (except the king) have only ambition as a personality trait. The characters are barely developed, and aside from Viserys no one seems to have a conscience, code, or consistency to their behavior.I watched through episode 9, and one plot point in particular inspired me to take a star off my rating and leave a review. I hate it when characters make pointless choices just to create action scenes or to keep the main plot going. Why did Rheanys risk her Dragon and herself to crash the enemy coronation, murder half of the King's Landing commoners in a rage, then spare her actual enemies? She could have ended the civil war by killing Aegon the Pederast and all of his powerful supporters but after killing a bunch of civilians she just flies away? She's bided her time patiently her entire life after being denied the throne that should have been hers ""by law and by temperament"". Yet in this moment of fury unchained she finds the restraint to spare the helpless enemies who were going to murder her and steal her dragon if she didn't capitulate to their demands? So stupid."
"Completely underwhelming. Boring, predictable & frankly, embarrassing. Com"
"pare the first 5 episodes to the same of GOT. Where are these high scores coming from. Bots, must be. 8.7 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. I can't name any of the characters, let alone care at all about them, because they are as stimulating as a cold cup caffeine-free coffee. Where is all this white hair coming from? Jon Snow (Aegon Targaryen) must have dyed his. Episode 5, which I just watched got 9.5. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Like Doctor Strange, I have traversed over to the MULTIVERSE. Sack the writers, and let's have something worthy of George RR Martin."
"6 episodes in and I'm unable to decipher what the actual main theme is aside from watching a bunch of babies being born, and dragons exhuming fire willy nilly.Episode 6 was really vulgar with a scene of a scrawny, barely pubescent, prince standing naked masturbating from a pulpit. I understand they want to keep the series raunchy, but I don't this is what the doctor (audience) ordered!Not to mention, it took me 20 mins to figure out the cast was changed, and significantly worse. No character building whatsoever. Watching this made me appreciate how good of a series GOT was, this isn't 1% as good!"
"TL;DR don't waste your time.I seriously don't understand how did this show get such a high rating (8.5 currently). I literally opened an account here just to normalize the rating a bit.Vast amount of long scenes in which absolutely nothing happens. Long conversations of little or no importance to the story: ""Your grace. May I have a word? Lord Commander, please. My queen, how is your grandsire. Fine, how are you?"" etc. Characters who are almost instantly forgettable. Main characters with unclear motives...It's as if someone wanted to tell you a story which spans over 10 decades, but emphasized only the least important aspects. In the end you're stuck listening to the person for 10 hours, learning nothing, expecting ""something"" to happen, only for the person to tell you: ""You know what. Now that I actually came to somewhat of an interesting point, I'm just gonna wrap it up here and leave you hanging for some time"". That's how I felt after the last episode - left alone after having 10 hours of my life literally wasted.I gave it 3/10 just for the first 3 episodes - those were actually interesting. The rest was a serious waste of time."
"I'm giving 5 stars, one for each passable episode. But what the heck happened in episode 6?What makes a story good? Conflict. Greater stakes make for an interesting story.There isn't much at stake, since there isn't a big menace. Daemon seems to be the biggest threat against the king, he seemed ambitious and smart, and basically has more balls than the most gullible king I've seen in any fiction. You may think great, there is a story. It builds at the right pace up until episode 5. Daemon and Rhaenys seem to have friction and the hots for each other, ok, interesting. They have a passionate encounter at her wedding with Laenor, then her father the king drops -you may think dead- but nope.Come episode 6, apparently 10 years have passed, that old dying king is pretty much alive ..hooray! Mid ages with a miraculous cure now he doesn't even cough , Whatever.Rhaenys is now married to Laenor, all that character building of an adventurous curious girl out the window. She is now bearing children one after the other (she vehemently didn't want to bear children) but wait there's more! The kids are from some random knight (watch of the city or something) a random new guy we don't give a damn about... And they don't even seem to be in love, there's not even a scene to show 'hey during those 10 years they grew on each other' or something.Meanwhile daemon is also having children, drinking and getting fat in somebody else's house, doing the married life (the ""ladies"" house days are over apparently) he doesn't give a dang about anything at all, he just retired. What? The point of building an interesting character is to show their ambitions. He was the only one who had them. He really wanted power. He did crazy things for it.Now for no reason at all he got married had children and wants to live off of some lord in the country?Not to mention after ten years Rhaenys looks 40 (she was around 16 before) daemon and Sir Criston didn't age a peep, not even a wrinkle or a gray hair.Btw to make things worse people usually detest when you cast new characters to make them age. That was a really really bad idea.Alicent went from virgin Mary Sue to wanna-be cersei.This sure is a mess and if it doesn't get fixed it's gonna flop like a warm flan. Turn it around, hire new writers or read a book on how to build characters, but don't waste this opportunity!"
"I was really looking forward to the HOTD, as having watched GOT and never having previously enjoyed a fantasy based show before.However I am on episode 7 and so far nothing has happened that would compel me to watch any more. If I do it will be because it is so poor it is hard to believe and of course its human nature to live in hope.None of the characters are compelling, they seem to have employed the most uncharismatic of actors, which is a shame as the likes of Rees Ifans is known for his ability to make an impact on screen, be it film or video.The script is turgid and trite, something a child could have written.There is precious little intrigue or characterisation as was so prevalent in GOT.Most annoyingly though is the lack of continuity. For example and"
without giving anything away a band of prisoners is recruited and undergo having their tongues removed.We then cut to seeing them laying a potential ambush - nothing occurs. We then see an associated fire - nothing happens. They then enter the building - nothing happens. And so why we saw them recruited in the first place as they did precisely nothing is symptomatic of the series so far.So I am also a prisoner of sticking with this but looking for an escape and living in hope things improve.
Heres the plot:
"Boring, boring, no character development, sudden act of violence, boring"
"Replace half the cast, then, boring, boring, no character develepment, becouse, no point of doing so - we will replace them again in 2 episodes anyway, sudden act of violence, dragon CGI, boring.No story to hang on to. We all know they were supposed to fight over throne, but thats really it so far (8 episodes in) As if it wasn't bad enough that character development is poor, they keep replacing them every few episodes"
"Still they will keep others an make them look not a day older.Princess has couple of new children, from diferent men, every few episodes. If you manage to keep track on all of them throughout the season consider your self HOTD expert."
"Paint by the numbers. Even the directors explanations of the episodes have them saying things like ""every good game of thrones season needs this this and this."" No... they don't. Game of thrones initially was good because it DID NOT need this this and this. It just allowed the world to naturally unfold. HoD does not do that.."
"Also, pretty much the entire plot is based around ""patriarchy=bad"" and it's kind of pathetic really. Game of thrones had that too but it was one of MANY subplots going on and it fit in the world. It still fits in this world but it's not a sub plot... its the. MAIN and ONLY plot. Again, this wouldn't be so bad if it was more like game of thrones with multiple different stories and perspectives. In this, its the only story/perspective.."
"That brings me to my next point, something that made GoT original so appealing was the multiple subplots and characters. There was a character for everyone, and all of them got pretty decent character development and screen time. House of Dragon only follows one storyline and can get dull pretty quick. Not to mention, that single storyline has basically no character development either. All the men are either evil or incompetent and don't grow, and the women just sit there and complain about how they could do better but won't ever be allowed to due to the patriarchy.."
"Also, I'm not sure how people can't see that the ""shock value"" scenes in HoD are literally the same as the later seasons of GoT. They make basically no sense whatsoever. All the ""shocking"" scenes in early GoT actually were pretty logical. The red wedding makes total sense if you are actually following the story, it wasn't shocking at all... The only shocking part about it is that a lot of viewers have grown accustomed to overuse of plot armor protecting protagonists from suffering consequences of their poor choices. The shocking scenes in HoD make no sense and are clearly just inserted in there because they don't understand what made the subverting expectation scenes in early GoT so good.."
"Overall this is a hollow shell of GoT, mostly being used as a form of virtue signalling by using an already popular brand name to insert feminist ideals. And yes, I watched every episode currently out (6 episodes) so this isn't just some incomplete emotional review. It was actually a chore to get through those episodes. I had to stop multiple times to take naps or go do something else to prevent myself from falling asleep. I have seen early GoT seasons 5+ times and I could still sit there and binge entire seasons if given the free time. HoD is worth the watch to have something to make fun of, but that's about it.."
I am genuinely surprised it has gotten so good reviews. Really makes me wonder if we actually watched the same series or if people just desperately want GoT content so much they are willing to put up with this trash simply to be a part of the world again.
"Chockfull of unlikeable characters and generally lacking what many enjoyed about Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon seems to serve very well as a companion series for those who have read Fire and Blood. However, for viewers who haven't read the book, the series falls flat. Let's be honest: if this wasn't a Game of Thrones spin-off, only a fraction of us would be watching and it would definitely end after a dismal first season.PROS -- The rich history of Westeros, as written by GRRM... Increased real world diversity and representation in their fictional universe... High production value. Costumes are excellent, wigs are getting better, and the (real and CGI) scenery looks beautiful.CONS -- Numerous time jumps and recastings. It's jarring for the viewer and to the story, often skipping years of the aforementioned lore... Conspicuous lack of dragons in House of the Dragon... Character development, intriguing politics, sharp dialogue, and decent action scenes are all few and far between."
"Interminable film-school dialogue, strung together with some cgi, along with a bit of gratuitous violence as a pastiche.How could the inheritors of such a commanding story drive it into the ground so thoroughly ?Like so many other endeavours, a new crew takes over the reigns to only suck the cash out of the franchise and introduce a formula for easy income.Yes, I see the pretty dragon's egg and the nice computer generated dragon, but where is the plot and the story and the action to go along with the eye candy ?Yes, I see the room full of anonymous orgy-goers, but who is doing what to who ? And how does it fit any plot ?What is being done to the deserving fans is that you are boring us to death as we rush to switch to another channel."
"I don't have a high bar in terms of what I find interesting to watch. But I really struggled with this, and found myself getting distracted by literally anything else.The story felt rushed. There was no character building, the subject jumped to different characters every 5 seconds. I barely even understood who everyone was, never mind having any interest in them. It felt a bit like being dropped into the middle of a political drama, half way through the series.The acting felt forced and sometimes over the top. And the special effects were almost made me cringe.They seem to have been trying to create some interest by injecting random violence and gore. Most of it was completely unrelated to the story and entirely without purpose.GoT captivated you from the very first scene, and almost every scene after it. This was the complete opposite.I will give episode 2 a try. It can only get better..."
"I really tried to like House of the Dragon, as I was a big fan of Game of Thrones. What it lacked was creativity, dynamic, and character depth. I find myself caring about very few of the characters, as most of them are shallow, 2 dimensional, or too predictable. Everyone was always so intense. There were no 'Bronn' characters that gave balance or lightness to a situation. Why should I care about a bunch of characters who are constantly awful and self indulgent but somehow never interesting? Aemon is always going to act foully. Larys Strong is just another Little Finger /Varys, and full of poisonous ideas.The C-sections and stillbirth's were unnecessarily grotesque. Something feels very wrong about seeing that displayed so recklessly on screen.Overall it felt very stale and unimaginative. Just a bunch of money thrown at a screen for easy views."
"I watched Game of Thrones twice and loved it.""House of the Dragon"" is a prequel to Game of Thrones and is mainly the story of the Targaryens., told in a slow and mind-boggling way.The overall atmosphere and the music are good, and the special effects are good enough. I think the show it is very well played, although the casting is problematic. Some characters are interesting enough, but the story focuses mostly on the female characters ergo the show is flat and dull. There is no room for suspense here, at the larger scale of the story.It's a slow burn and It is interesting about 10 ~20%, the rest is mostly a soap opera with some sex-related stuff.In my opinion, the ""PC"" culture has affected this series on every level, from casting to storytelling.For now, House of the Dragon (2022-) falls in the spectrum of mediocrity and it made me wonder which category of viewers it is intended for..."
"You don't need to recast ADULTS to show a time just; you just age them up. The new actors are objectively worse and less suited for their roles. I swear to god HBO is just trying to piss off fans at this point. It's a good show but not a great show like Game of Thrones. There are just so many characters but unlike Game of Thrones, they don't have ties that bring them together. It's just weaker and I hope they stop pulling this nonsense but we'll see obviously the show is much better than a 1/10 probably 7.5 but I have to vent my annoyance at these pointless recasts somehow! Anyway, good show but the producers need to think before they act."
"I get that with the passing of time in shows it can be difficult to ""age"" the actors/actresses. But with technological capabilities today it cannot POSSIBLY be that hard to make someone look older. I got invested in the initial characters for the first 5 episodes and in episode 6 was like WTF. Expecting it to be some odd dream or nightmare before realizing this was the dumbest possible way to age a cast. BIG MISTAKE. Took this show from legit to lame in a split second. Not only are they different actors for key/main characters they honestly don't even get close to being ""look alikes""! If you're going to have someone step in as an older version of a main character than at least do them the courtesy of finding a real world ""twin""."
"I watched the first episode last night and was disappointed. The characters lacked depth, none of them managed to create an emotional connection with me. I might have been the acting: I was seeing actors, not characters.There was something with the CGI. Mist and whispy clouds all over the place, but too prominent and too artificial. Brick walls that looked like texture-maps, it all somehow felt not quite right. The dragons where impressive, until taking flight. I appreciate it is difficult to model a flying dragon correctly, but the tail of the dragon in flight seemed to have nu problem with air resistance during flight and the movement of it's back during take off would have thrown any human of its back right away.I could specify more aspects of this episode that dissapointed but overall, it felt cheaper, it lacked the deep, immersive quality of Game of Thrones."
Very dissatisfied with this predictable story line. Not many interesting characters. Poor quality wigs that were very distracting and ridiculous looking on some of the characters.
"I had such high hopes for this show. GoT set the bar ridiculously high of course, but this is just a complete let down.There is absolutely no chemistry between characters, no real story, and the time jumps are just weird. In the entire time frame they went through till episode 6, this was the most interesting to tell?I also feel some woke checkboxes had to be met, as is with almost everything released now.In GoT every character had a real story, depth and you actually felt something. Everything came together beautifully.In HotD I feel like I'm still waiting for the show to start at episode 6, which probably isn't happening."
"So bored watching all 7th episodes,so slow story without any passion or interested Flix,not impressed with camera angle or shots how this series is done Very poor and bland selection of actors. Storytelling is something what make me going to sleep right away and never come back to watch another. We are coming of era when movies and series of this kind are getting so cheap and without any enthusiasm to make thing better. I wonder how someone this screen writing takes so sirisly to create something so boring like this. I hope someone read some of this critics to fix this mess what adience watch on this home screen Very disappointed."
"This all just feels so... rushed. Not the storyline, because that was same pace to GoT, but I feel like the dunk and egg stories would've make a better buffer. It has similar struggles to GoT, but without all the intrigue. We just finished a series on the struggle for the iron throne and all the political intricacies that come with it, I don't think we need more of the same, but with less interesting cast, storylines, and special effects. I'll give it a chance, but the entire show just felt like it was living in the shadow of GoT and didn't bring anything new to the table."
"Truly awful series. Five episodes in and NOTHING has happened. Just political match making- who will marry whom. Not to mention the cringy overacting by all. Torn between packing it in now or keep watching in the hope that it picks up. After all GOT started off a bit slow. However I'm rapidly losing patience. Life's too short.Incidentally why does everything have to look like 14th century England? Jousting, drinking from goblets, dressing the same, 14th century style music.....I'm waffling now to use up the necessary number of characters... blah blah blah...And don't believe all the fake 10/10s."
"Getting through episode one felt like a chore and to be honest I would rather watch paint dry. How this show is at #102 for best television series ever is beyond me. As someone who was absolutely in love with Game of Thrones up until obviously season 8, it made me kind of sad watching House of the Dragon because that magical spark that grabbed me from the beginning of Game of Thrones and never let go is not present at all here. The cgi is noticeably worse and for some reason the look of the show just doesn't feel nearly as grand or beautiful as Game of Thrones did. The script and acting is also very flat and unlike the characters in Game of Thrones, there is no reason as far as I can tell that I should be rooting for any of these characters whatsoever."
"You will watch weak characters. Weak script. With a nice scenary and music (same of GoT). They want this second Daenerys support all the weight of the show, and it's impossible. The only character i admired a bit was Daemon, buuuuut when i finished chapter 2 i thought he was a coward. What a bluff...That works the same for books in real life (i am not talking about got now). If your history (not talking about narrative style) is weak... and your characters are also weak...Remember, the scenary (dragons, world, clothing) is good. So, they can try to cheat you. And also you can watch one or two decent scenes per chapter. But don't forget about characters and narration."
"Like many people, after the disastrous GoT 7th and 8th seasons, I decided to watch HOTD with skepticism, but still hopeful.... Unfortunately, everything about these series (based on the two first episodes) is terrible. GoT was a masterpiece. It's story and characters were magnificent and captivating. I consider GoT the best series ever produced on television (not considering 7th and 8th seasons!).House of the Dragon cannot follow the success of GoT. This series suffers from not having one single attractive character. None of them have charisma, charm, wit, intelligence, and good looks to show for. The acting is terrible with expressionless princesses and kings who have ZERO CHARISMA. The actress playing the teenager Targaryen princess is one of the worst characters in the series. She cannot act and comes across as she is detached from everything that goes on, which isn't much, so far.The actor playing the defiant Targaryen brother looks more like an Elf. Besides that, he is also very unattractive and uninteresting. The charisma, charm, sexiness and intelligence from ALL characters at GoT are completely absent with these Targaryens who make you feel like you are watching some poorly made version of Lord of the Rings.GoT had some realness about itself that made the show very relatable, memorable and remarkable. The fantasy would take us away into new territory, while the suffering, losses, betrayals, love stories, perversions, cruelty, malice, and hope that goodness would triumph over evil made us feel very real about it, as if we were there with them, experiencing their battles, sadness, disappointments, anguish, and struggles. This new series cannot ever capture the realism and magnificence of GoT. The CGI is horrible. The show is mostly shot in some dark colors, the interactions are very monotone. The black actors feel out of place, and it is inevitable to think that political correctness lead to this poor choice of casting black actors to play volaryen /Targaryen characters. The woke culture is really destroying everything they touch. The story line about a mid 40 year old king being pressured to marry a 12 year old child was uncomfortable to see and gave some pedophilia vibes. I understand that Targaryens married their brothers and sisters, so incest was a common aspect of their history, but the scene about a 12 year old girl telling an adult that she doesn't have ""to bed"" him until she is 14 was a bit much, even for the GoT world, and strangely, the dialogue was very bland.I highly doubt that this series can improve and take us to the marvelous journey that GoT did. In the end, I know that I have to watch GoT again if I ever want to relive the emotions that I once experienced by watching a series such as GoT was. I already watched 5 times and will be watching for the 6th time very soon. If you are a hardcore fan of GoT and fully embraced the events that made GoT a masterpiece, you will be thoroughly disappointed with HOTD!"
"Ok so it's only one episode, so people should be cautious with the overly negative and the overly positive reviews. However, it's hard to look past the following when giving this show a ratingFirstly, the first episode of House of the dragon is not a patch on the first episode of Game of Thrones, anyone who says it's as good as or better is talking utter rubbish and that isn't an opinion it's a factSecondly, what is it with the CGI in films and tv shows these days. Nothing looks real, the stone of the walls and Castles, looks exactly what it is, a computer rendered graphic, same with the crowd scenes, so, so poor bit I expect nothing else these days.Thirdly, there isn't a single character from the opening episode who interested me whatsoever. In comparison to a game of Theones were there where multiple characters that piqued ones interest, right from the offsetFourthly, Sex and violence........ the sex, try as they may, it was just boring. If they are not going to do it properly and convincingly, then why bother having it at all. The violence, about the only thing in this episode that they got right. It was graphic and bloody, just as this type of drama should be, so thumbs up for that.I'll hold off on any proper judgement until at least three episodes have aired but I will be shocked if it gets much better but hey, I've been wrong in the past."
"I'm writing this review in the middle of episode 10...because I'm bored beyond belief...though admittedly this is the most (only) interesting episode of the series (great dragon battle).The beginning of episode 10 was laughably dominated watching and hearing yet another gruesome, screaming, blood and ooze filled birthing scene, as if that somehow passes for engaging television. It's as if the director knew how boring the program was, and had a list of ""shocking"" scenes to add in whenever the paint dried too much (dragons, birthing, beheading, sodomy...and random time jumps).Throw in a few shots of the iconic map of the land, a few mentions of buzz words like Stark, Lannister and Baratheon and voila....some people apparently soak it up with the original brilliant theme song like a rag used to wipe up one of Rhaenyra's afterbirths. Maybe some people actually enjoyed this, but there's no way the real world rated this any higher than 6."
"Remember how GoT started? The first encounter with the white walkers? And then with the beautiful Stark family that you instantly loved, unaware of the mayhem awaiting them? I've watched the whole series 3 times and the beginning even more often than that. It's was such an excellent start of the series, that kept you on your toes every episode. Every character had beautiful depth, whether you liked them or not and you wanted to know what happened to them. Yes, dragons, but even they had a secundary role as far as the abundant storylines went. Nothing of the HotD reminds me of this. Sometimes I wonder if I'm watching Shrek enacted by ridiculously whigged puppets. I'm watching this with my eyes rolling every two minutes and apparently the music has to warn me that some important scene is going on. Every episode seems to skip 5 years in time which I can understand because the whole story is a dull as a door nail. I got an HBO subscription for this ffs. For the life of me I can't understand why it has such a high rating on imdb, certainly I'm never gonna trust any imdb rating again, thanks a lot. It even irritates me that they're allowed to use the GoT tune, bc so far they're not worthy of it."
"So many bad wigs, ugh. You'd really think the wig budget would be so much higher for an HBO show. The weird and forced woke/diversity shots became tiresome. We get it, there are minorities in the cast. We don't need a cut away every 15 seconds to show how diverse it is. Just stop already.On a positive note, Matt Smith is excellent in it. One of the few characters with actual presence.And I'm really happy to see that Chaka, from Land of the Lost, has finally landed a lead role. It's well overdue."
"After two episodes, I gave up watching this one. It's a decent tv series that fails miserably reaching to the level of GoT.The thing that bothers me most is the reliance only on a single storyline. For instance, we already have a possibly interesting character called ""crabfeeder"" but there hasn't been told anything about him. GoT has multiple interesting storylines in the same episode that sometimes converge and diverge into other stories.If you want to relive the epicness of GoT, then watch it again. This one is like a food similar to your favorite from outside but it tastes foul after one bite."
"I could not even get past the first episode. It was disgustingly gory and violent, but the gore and violence was shallow and gratuitous because no time had been spent developing the characters first. At least in the original GOT (which I am a HUGE fan of), there was character development almost immediately which made you invested in the characters, and thus invested in their opposing ends. GOT was super violent and gory too, but at least there were notions like honor, pride in one's family, coming to terms with one's history, star-crossed lovers, etc. I saw none of that here and will not finish the series because of it."
"Everytime a decent plot starts to develop they dump it and do a time jump without any warning. Then Recasting 2 of the main characters with people 3 or 4 years older for a time jump was quite a bad move too. Characters lack any sort of depth and everything is extremely rushed. Damon's dragon is very odd looking as well. Nowhere near its predecessor game of thrones standards. Struggled to get through the last half.... Probably won't be bothering for a second season, kept hoping itd get better but i was sorely disappointed. Complete lack of white walkers probably doesn't help things because it comes off as more of a historical drama rather than a fantasy show despite the dragons."
"After the very first episode, I became pretty excited about the series. Then, what happened? Episode after episode went by, but no real story had taken place yet. Just some family rivalry, that also without any actual happening. Is it a family drama? Six episodes into the series, yet there is nothing to be excited about.I loved watching dragons in GOT. But, in HOTD, I feel pity watching them. Merely any impact in the storyline; instead just a kind of showoff. Here in HOTD, they became the object of child's play. Sorry Dragons, you deserve better.What is this? After many years of preparation for a prequel, they came up with this? Disappointed."
"This show is absolute boring drivel. I never feel so strongly to leave reviews for shows but this show deserves to be known as such. Red keep could be demolished by a meteor in the next episode and I wouldn't feel one emotion for any of the characters.The dialog is convoluted and a spewing of random unmemorable family names and historical nonsense. The political ""game of thrones"" is infuriatingly uninteresting. The battles have no build up or explanation for why a certain group is the antagonist. Little to no gore except random violence for no explainable reason to characters that were just introduced.The king is a pushover. The princess an unlikeable brat.The brother a troublemaker just for troubles sake. They do multiple actor swaps and timeline jumps deleting any ounce of likeability you had for any character.Friends don't let friends watch this pointless nonsense."
"First episode very disappointing.It all feels like some sort of soap opera mixed with the sequel (the original GoT).There is a dragon scene that looks like it was made by a 10 year old playing around with 3D studio max for the first time.And from the very beginning I already knew how the episode was going to end. Where is the thrilling plot? Where is the amazing production?They even recycled the soundtrack from GoT?!?!?VERY disappointed.Maybe disappointment is not the right word: a bad feeling was creeping even before i watched the episode. May I be biased?After all George RR Martin did take his time writing the GoT books and this feels like a cash grab of some sorts.I know you will be feeling excited when you first watch it, but believe me when I tell you, you will find the same disappointment you felt when you when you watched the last season of Got.There are no signs of any depth or even effort in this first episode.I will keep watching in the hope it gets better, but I sadly feel it won't."
"It has the look and feel of game of thrones, throwing all the names, sets, violence and sex at you that you know and love from the original. But without providing any substance, intriguing or complex characters. It's a pale imitation of (and shamelessly making every attempt to imitate) the original and the best storyline it can muster is some one dimensional squabbling over succession. Everyone wants the iron throne, nobody makes much of a secret of it. The current king is about as charismatic and interesting as the ulcer on his back we have to keep seeing. There's only so many cheap shocks you can throw at audiences and they've used them all by episode 3Don't get me wrong there's enough game of thronesy action to keep you watching, with plenty of entertaining scenes such as the joust. But quality tv this is not."
If you ever clowned on the prequel star wars series please do it some justice by attacking this show equally! Can someone please explain to me how 30 minutes of exposition to start a series in a mostly known universe is a good choice? This first episode showed how little the writers understand this world just watch the tourney and compare how many died vs yielded. Trash writing.Trash storytelling (honestly felt like i was watching the summary of a fanfic story). What a let down!
"The show's departure from the gritty, complex world of GOT left me somewhat disappointed. The intricate political intrigue and morally ambiguous characters that defined GOT are noticeably absent here. Instead, we're presented with a more straightforward narrative that, at times, feels like a diluted version of its predecessor.On the positive side, Daemon and Viserys stand out as compelling characters with depth and nuance. Their complex motivations and intricate relationships add layers to the storyline. However, the supporting cast often falls flat, lacking the depth needed to truly engage the audience.Perhaps my disappointment stems from the unfair comparison to the groundbreaking GOT series. While this show has its merits, it struggles to capture the same magic that made its predecessor a cultural phenomenon. I'll continue watching, hoping that it finds its footing and delivers the gripping storytelling that I associate with the Game of Thrones universe."
"I will add one star for costumes and scenery. But the rest is just awful.GOT had atmosphere, you were genuinely interested in the characters, their story and how they develop. GOT punished bad decisions not seldom with death of the protagonist. There is no escape from the unevitable in Westeros..HOTD on the other hand has none of this. Characters are shallow without development, decisions and battles are predictable. The script feels computer generated: Have people use ancient costumes in a picturesque scenery, throw in some unfair treatments, some gore, some sex, some battles and dragons on top and there is you show. There is no story, just scenes.When I saw GOT Red Wedding episode I was shocked, I was upset, I was sad. I knew what was coming before it came. Because in GOT there is just no last minute rescue (well at least not before it tuned bad).When I saw HOTD Episode 3, I was sure that Daemon would make it (and wouldn't even care if he didn't). Because there is always some Dragon/Hero that rescues the main characters.In the last second. Predictable, boring and overly brutal.Where is the suspense? Where is the anger? Where is the sadness? This series makes me feel nothing. Without the gore this could well be a Disney production (including the PC). It's like Star Wars Episode 1. A waste of time.I don't think I will continue watching, I rather rewatch GOT."
"I found the first episode a little extreme almost as if they felt they needed to start with shock value. Then I began to settle into the story of political intrigue. I especially enjoyed the work of Considine, Alcock & Carey which unfortunately turned from positive to negative. The two young women who were keys to early episodes suddenly got replaced by older actresses. It was jarring to say the least. This was a huge mistake by Martin who also toyed with a time jump in ASoI&F but reconsider it. I can't imagine how GoT TV show would have been undermined if they had replaced all the young actors. Martin should certainly know that things that work in a book don't necessarily work on tv. Add the fact that Considine has been hanging on by a thread since the beginning and well... Additionally there was the typical HBO added content. I have no problems with nudity but thought the orgy scene served no purpose other than to make me hope it would end.On the brighter side the special effects were stunning. The dragons have come such a long way since GoT debuted them and the action scene were well choreographed tho a little brutal for my taste. The performances were strong and the main characters well developed. If only the writers considered the fans more important than a needless plot gimmick Id still be watching."
"The characters are bland, the politics heavy plot insipid, and even Matt Smith's acting could not rescue this bomb. G Martin should have stayed out of the script writing business and finished books 6 and 7 of GOT instead.HBO clearly failed to provide any creative oversight over this series. Stop hiring no talent hacks. Season 8 of GOT should have been warning enough. $200 million down the drain."
"4 episodes in and this isbutterly predictable with minimally engaging individual performances. I can't get around the feeling that they are just recycling old story lines. While both Grey Worm and Missandei were absolutely horrendous performances in GoT, House of the Dragon seems to make mediocre acting the new normal. Nothing about this has been special so far, not even the CGI. Hard to believe someone signed off on this. I really hope that the character arcs and the plot thickens at least somewhat, because if it continues like this, I'm not sure I'll be able to continue to watch it.I understand that this is based on one of Martin's novel, but surely there has to be a way to make this less terrible than it ultimately is."
"Like a lot of GOT viewers i felt cheated with the poor quality of seasons 6-8. When i heard they were making HOD i am sure i was not alone in thinking that here is a chance to put thing right. New brooms sweep clean. And i really wanted to like this show.So far i have watched up to Episode 6. In fact i have actually seen Episode's 1-5 twice as i wanted to be sure what i felt was right and that i wasn't missing something that made this as good as some people think it is.It is gruelling to watch it twice. No, it's gruelling to watch it once. After the first episode I was cautiously optimistic but after that it just lost me. The characters are lacking any form of depth. The actors are just walking through it as if they are asleep. No wonder - the script has no vigour no flourish and worse the whole thing is utterly utterly humourless. And the jerky time setting just seals what i can only call a disaster. To be able to carry that kind of storyline this needs to have real plot depth, be really plot heavy. But it isn't. It's plot thin. It can't carry the time spacing because the storyline is heavily dependent on just one premise - the succession. It's lazy storytelling. It is like instead of making amends for the paucity of details in the original GOT seasons 6-8, these have been grasped upon and magnified. Everything that made the later seasons of GOT bad is amplified here. We can't root for any of the characters, they have no depth, we don't KNOW these people. Subsequently it's hard to care what happens to them. And the quality of the acting is poor. Unlike others who have complained about the use of black actors to fulfil some characters, i wouldn't normally have a problem with inclusivity but this feels like tokenism. The actors themselves deserve better. A time jump of ten years have replaced the mincingly speaking Queen Alicent to an adult along with other characters who have aged accordingly but for some reason Sir Cristan remains the same still mooching around like a toddler who has had his teddy stolen. The King is irritating. Daemon looks like he is having difficulty not bursting out laughing. I can only imagine the enormous sum of $200 million has been spent on the ridiculously over dressed sets and costumes but while they were at it could Hairdressing have had some of the budget as the wigs look exactly what they are - wigs - at best unconvincing at worst actually laughable. The CGI is nothing to write home about either - especially the hunting scene with the stag. Filming in a sepia tone leaves everything drab and dull. This is supposed to be a world of colour. Subsequently it is hard to tell when characters switch locations because everywhere looks exactly the same.This is a tv series where HBO have slapped the Game of Thrones label on and attempted to sell it to people who fell in love with the original series. In a word it is exploitative. We've been duped. Apparently a second season has been commissioned but without one of the prime movers and shakers Miguel Sapochnik who has got out. But i don't think anything can save this from being the drab disaster that it is.Maybe the series which is allegedly being made by Kit Harrington (working title SNOW) will gave us GOT fans what we want? I am skeptical. Time HBO spent money elsewhere instead of trying to capitalise on something long gone. Some of it was beautiful when it lasted. Leave us with those memories please."
"I really cant understand what has gone so wrong with this show. After the terrible ending of GOT I was thinking that maybe this was a chance to revive my interest for the world of Westeros. Fisrt seasons of GOT were amazing so I had my expectations quite high. However, HOTD failed miserably...It is just a medieval type soap opera and to be honest, it is a bad one. Characters lack depth and the whole story does not have the edge you expect at all... The only good things are the acting and photography (ok and the dragons) but even these can not save the day in such a boring show. And I really can't understand is why??? They have the story, they have great actors and they have very good budget... What on earth is going so wrong...?"
"Casting is terrible and seems intentionally confusing. No one ages at the same rate. The king looks like he has been rotting for 20 years and his brother stays 35. Kids grow at soap opera pace. Grown up actors don't match their child versions, rather their siblings.I know it's not GOT so not comparing but I just thought it'd be a broader story with better writing. The only storyline is the family soap opera which is hilariously entertaining. The violence is laughable and the fighting looks like kids with play swords. Sound is very odd... they make sure you hear all the slurping, labor groans, wheezing, squishing ... basically all off putting sounds are clear as a bell. No musical relief. Indecipherable accents. HBO phoned this in pretty hard."
"The first few episodes were pretty good, although not up to GOT standards. Then, in episode 4, Princess Rhaenyra - who had been noble, wise & ethical - suddenly and inexplicably becomes a sleaze, pairing up with what had been her nemesis. Absolutely out of the blue and without any rhyme or reason. Completely lost me on that one.Then, episode 6. Some of the main characters are now suddenly played by new (inferior) actors. This was probably to accommodate the sudden 10-year leap in time (although the actors replaced could have still been used effectively). This was probably the nail in the coffin for me. This whole mess seemed very sloppy and rushed.And I'm sure there's a few 17-year-olds out there that only care about seeing CGI dragons, but they do nothing for me. I'd rather see them focus on well-crafted plot and characters instead."
"I had high hopes for this. 1-3 Episodes were good. Matt Smith and Milly Alcock were great. Episode 4: the big timeskip 20 years, actors are replaced... House of the Queens becomes expensive soap opera, where events happen in speech. 3 years later-10 years later -20 years later, in few episodes....? Incohesive story plot and ruined immersion. Could you stop destroying popular IP-s, by rushing through the plot.... ?Commerce and political views, dont need to be pushed and spoonfed in every TV show.Fans want to see Martin's 2018 book ""Fire & Blood"" version of this story.I hope they can salvage this, but i fear its too late. Too much plot and timeskips, have allready happened.Truly, go back making SOAPS and stop destroying IPs, where there is huuge fanbase , from the books."
"I cannot really believe that they replaced the main actors at episode 6!!!!!!!!???!!! No intro, no connection point just a time jump and then theh only replaced the two protagonists!They completely destroyed the show.Such a pity. Shame!When I was young, I was watching with my grandparents the Bold and the Beautiful. Yeap, that show way better reflected the time jumps.I feel as if I committed myself to a show and then they just don't care.This is a very angry review for the most obvious reasons! I loved the protagonists and the producers/directors could not even keep the same actors for one season, their job is done.Sorry bur not sorry."
"All talky talky no fighty fighty, it makes Phantom Menace look fast paced and exciting. The producers go to great lengths to say it's not Game of Thrones. And they are correct. No characters you like or dislike enough to care about either way. Characters you might get to like are stymied by plodding dialogue, chunky story telling, plot place that either drags on far too long or story lines that go no further than one episode. When a character does actually start to resonate, they're a totally different character in the next episode. There are almost no dragons in House of the Dragon. Not until the very last minutes of the very last episode, which are shamefully more of a teaser trailer for Season 2 than anything to do with season 1."
"Well I'm persevering to the end but I can't help but feel this is a major let down compared to the excitement and thrill of GOT. Ok so it's a prequel I get that - but there's just no excitement and I don't have the same urge for the next episode as I did with GOT. I could take it or leave it.I expected more. Half way through the series sone actors have been replaced, as the characters have got older, yet others (the King for example) is the same actor but has been made to look older. Another character - same actor yet character looks no older ten years later. It makes no sense whatsoever and has really ruined it for me."
"Every week I kept giving it a chance. Not any more. I have watched 5 episodes so far.1. Actors play flat (except Martin Smith) emotionlessly, main characters are unlikable, very bad casting!2. No plot, what is it about? It is all bla bla bla..no essence3. Don't get me started on actress playing the future queen. She has one face all the time: happy, sad, stressed, she is a walking meme.4. I really miss the spice, the wow effect that was in every single episode of Game of thrones, that make you wonder what happens next, this undefined tension they created in the end of each episode. You won't find it here.Don't waste your time as I did."
"This so called prequel is a failure. It is painful to see the actors and their characterization. After seeing 6 episodes we can surely say that is not even close to the original show GOT which makes it kind of insulting to its fans.It is parody acting, where you keep waiting either Kenan Thompson to appear with dreadlocks silver hair or even Jimmy Fallon sitting in the iron throne sipping a Budweiser made in Westeros with a sitcom background laughter.The acting is so bad and superficial, only 3 o 4 locations so far, and the so called seeds of war are being planted by boring characters with cheap wigs upon their heads.The ""house of the dragon"" is homestead of teenage drama and gossip with little to none dragons in their pit.It keeps jumping ahead leaving gaps into the storyline that can be obvious, but it is just off.There is no depth into the story, nothing gets you attention and is interesting enough to follow through, the TV script basically start and kill every underlined subject in a single episode, nothing builds nor escalates.The succession war we were promised is only a few comments of who will rise to the throne after the king dies, something that's taken for granted by generalization of the story.It is unpleasant, uninterested, empty, boring and at this point unnecessary story of house Targaryen."
"I honestly thought after the appalling last series of GOT, HoTD had to be a good remedy for my disappointment. How wrong I was.It's a shame George R R Martin didn't concentrate his efforts on finishing his first saga before embarking on another... money talks I guess and integrity walks.So what have we got? A plot that a 14 year old could write, bland characters, a bit of TITillation, and some misplaced actors who should have known better before signing up to appear in this steaming pile of dragon dung (and no, I'm not including Matt Smith, who performance is as wooden as some of the stage sets) Was a GOT fan (up to the end of series 7) but definitely NOT a HoTD aficionado. Should be renamed The House That Drags On and on and on and on..."
"This show is boring. Benioff and Weiss wrote clever, witty, funny, lovable, hated, and revered characters when writing GOT. Where is the biting wit? Where is the blood and gore?I find myself falling asleep while trying to give this show a chance. I am watching this while back to back rewatching GOT and it is an insult to compare to two or to even put them in the same category. GOT is the better series (even after the letdown of season 8). GOT will be remembered and rewatched but I doubt very many will sing this shows praises and return to rewatch it just to relive the ""magic"".Such a shame."
"I just finished watching episode 5 and I didn't see anything interesting so far. Just a crazy family fighting for the throne. Like in a cheap soap opera when they fight for the inheritance of the uncle, who was a billionaire who suddenly died.All the scenes are focused only on 1 family and 1 place. You cannot compare it with Game of Thrones where the action was happening in 7 places at the same time and it was focused on several families.On top of everything, I cannot say I like any of the characters. All of them are ugly souls.All in all, a big disappointment. They could have make something special with all the money they invested in this under average soap opera."
"I wasnt going to watch anymore of this rubbish but wasnt well and decided to give it another look, wish I hadn't bothered.The characters in this show are not at all interesting and the scenery also rather dull.The storyline rushes from one thing to another and it doesn't really make much sense. The story goes so quickly there's almost a child born to the queen every episode and that's about all that happens. To make things even more absurd the princess has 3 children between one episode and the next.After 6 episodes there's nothing that stands out to make it even half as good as the Game Of Thrones."
"Everything could have worked out here. The actors are gorgeous, the scenery is unparalleled, the characters are interesting, and at first it seemed like a solid plot with filigree dialogues. But by episode 6, I bitterly have to admit that ""House of the Dragon"" is stillborn and nothing can save it. Changing the actresses and yet leaving many of the minor characters as they were, depriving us of even the rudiments of empathy for anyone at all. The whole tattered, rushed, trying to intrigue every second of the plot has become a dopamine-tinged irritant of frame changes. There's nowhere to breathe, and in this stuffiness, things get even worse and more ridiculous. The perpetually tedious female labor, on and on, in circles. The only confrontation between the princess and the queen that doesn't fall almost out of frame, after the change of actresses looks sterilized and failed. The same thing happens to absolutely all the characters by episode 6 and I don't think they can get out of this hole anymore. It's boring, drab, all reduced to childbirth and facial grimaces, Dragon Downton Abbey is no different."
"I'm embarrassed to admit this but I have seen Game of Thrones more than 200 times and love it except for the last season, so I was so excited to watch House of the DRAGON because it would not take much to make this a sensational show.THEY FAILED MISERABLY!GOT was so good because the character development was fantastic and viewers were in love with some characters while we despised others.. and some we were undecided about from the first episode.."
The acting and cast were second to none except for a few actors who aren't that great but viewers didn't notice sub par acting because the supporting cast carried everyone..because they are so darn good.House of the Dragon has shockingly bad actors especially Millie Alcock and it was obvious because the rest of the cast wasn't much better and they had a terrible script that didn't help.It's really bad when every single character could be killed off and I would have been happy because maybe they might introduce someone interesting.. and not the boring mob we had to endure watching.The storyline is ridiculous and doesn't exploit GOT's popularity by focusing on the dragons.. I would have loved to see how the original Targaryens raised and trained dragons because Danaerys didn't have a clue..
There were so many mistakes and things that didn't make sense and the storyline was all over the place.. and we didn't even see any crazy Targaryens often mentioned in GOT.. because of the in breeding..
I would have loved to see things like babies being tested to see if they are fireproof because not all Targaryens are fire proof.The story could have been sensational but it certainly was not..
"So no character development, a shockingly bad storyline and sub par acting .."
Well done ruining what could have been a fantastic show. As for the good reviews they are clearly posted by people with beer goggles on who are either very young or people so excited they didn't even watch the show properly..
"-Script is flat, repeats itself for 4 episodes.-enemies lack context, they don't speak, there;s no back story to the conflict, the battles have no pointss other than being battles.100% CRAP!-The Scenery is ok, but it's alot of CG"
-The costumes are decent.-The script is just absolute trash.---
"They took 15 minutes of script and stretched it to 4 episodes. ""it is my duty"" ""it is your duty"" ""it is my duty"" ""it is your duty"" repeat repeat repeat.."
WE GET IT! SHUT UP ABOUT IT! WRITE BETTER!---
"Sadly, none of this will matter to the sheeple, the phone addicts with 2 second attention spans.----"
"3 out of 10 stars is what this deserves from a standard review. If you read through google reviews and here, you'll notice that approx half of the reviews are fake."
"I am finding it very difficult to say exactly how it differs (feeling wise) from Game of Thrones, but it does and in the most mind numbing and painful way.I have really tried to give this series a go... several times. But this goes way beyond any weird masochistic curiosity I might be able to muster to get me through this series and have to call it quits.Definitely the worst series I have thought may be interesting enough to give a try, that I can think of off hand - 3.5/10, as effects and general visuals I cannot complain about. Just the complete and utter mindlessness it makes you feel watching it."
"They basically dressed actors up in a old way but gave them the problems we are having in 2022. A feminist princess,a queen who is sick of being a queen also I forgot to mentioned the protecter of the princess who wants to explore the world and see what's beyond my suggestion for this guy is that he should join the Erasmus+ program jokes aside unlike game of thrones,story has no layers almost no gray areas. Gray areas and layered story were the trademarks of got. I'm not saying this is bad but from what game of thrones showed us,I was kinda expecting the same from this series and I'm not talking about the glorious battle scenes,dragons etc. I'm taking about the script which is way weaker than got. Long story short if you want to see few dragons and people in medieval costumes you won't be disappointed."
"I had such high hopes for this show. I was legitimately intrigued and loving the story the first few episodes. Once the first time jump happens you can tell the timing, characters, story, and general intrigue starts to take a decline. I was holding out for the much built up finale and seriously expecting something awesome to pay off the long dragged out and honestly boring couple of episodes leading up to the finale, and was heavily, heavily disappointed. The last 2 episodes are basically just there to set up the next season to drag out viewership. I honestly feel cheated. The entire season is built up to absolutely nothing. No pay off, no satisfaction, no resolution to anything set before it, just....nothing. The ""finale"" legitimately disappointed me enough that I am not even interested in watching the second season when it eventually debuts. You get the feeling that this is a very greedy cash grab and viewer baiting to drag out the GOT magic and its fanbase as long as they can to drain as much profit as they can. I'm still in awe that they ended this much promising show the way that they did. Started out so amazingly, with so much potential, only to go out with a whimper of ""well...that was a thing I was expecting way more more from and it never came through"""
"I have an honest question. First off I did not read the books but I did watch and enjoy GOT, my question is were the black characters in HOTD also in the books or were these injected into the script for the sake of wokeness? Aside from that this can not compare to GOT, this series is leaning very much towards soap opera.If I'm wrong so be it but wokeness is ruining so many movies and television shows these says I would hate to think this series is another casualty. When books that are much loved are fundamentally changed to suit an agenda we as a society have lost the plot and we are already spiraling down the drain."
"Only watched episode 1 but I am really disappointed.The acting is very stiff and not a single character is interesting to follow. They don't come across as being really in their roles.The wigs look very fake, why can't they make it look like real hair?The dialogue has no wit at all, the story development is so predictable you can fall asleep after ten minutes and you won't miss anything.Even the dragons have no gravitas.It feels like a boring Netflix clip.Very, very disappointing.Who cast these actors? Hollywood has so many talented people, why did they put together such a weak team??They have nice costumes and sets, so you can watch it for that.No mystery, no excitement, no sense of humor.Sad."
"Season 1 really started out promising and I very much liked young Alicent and Rhaenyra. There was that same tension as GoT always had and I thought that this season was going to be amazing.After the first time jump the show immediately lost me. Why they would replace these 2 actresses with slightly older women and leaving Daemon and that bodyguard at the same age for the entire season still baffles me.Not only did their appearance change, their personalities changed way too much too. Gone were 2 likeable characters, replaced by power craving, mean people.The 2 following time jumps made this problem even greater, replacing actors with people that hardly looked like them. No way that scrawny Aemond grows up to that Daemon imitator. Personalities and age seemed to be jumbled at random for all the replaced actors.There's no one to root for as they're all just plain evil now. There is no clear good guy or likeable protagonist.The story itself is not layered as it was in GoT season 1. There's just the one plot line and in each episode not much happens except for talking, way too many child birthing scenes, nudity and dragons flying around. There's is no tension building or exciting progress being made in this season. It is all very slow and soapy with a lot of talking and more talking. Each episode contains one brief shocking moment to hold your attention.And then episodes 9 and 10, where each GoT season went out with an exciting bang: nothing. 2 slow episodes that contained one short shocking moment, letting the season end with a whimper instead of a bang.Rhaenys not going Dracarys on the entire Green Party was baffling, why let her enter so dramatically to just let her fly away. I expected big battles in the last 2 episodes, but all we got was that Rhaenys scene, more gruesome child birth scenes and the Aemond Lucerys moment, which took place in the last 5 minutes of the season.This season felt a lot like setup for the next one. I still hardly know most of the characters and for the largest part of the season not much happened. Where are the B, C and D plotlines in the story? Got season 1 was miles ahead of this first HotD season.I don't understand why this is rated 9's and 10's by everyone. From a story telling aspect it is really not that superb as the ratings are trying to make you believe.It looks and sounds great but story and characters are seriously lacking, as is a protagonist to root for.I hope next season will be better instead of being Green's Anatomy or One Shade of Black."
"Who could like this series, who? The plot is so weak we don't care. The characters lack so much depth we don't care. The setting is so dull and dark and rocky we don't care. The dragons are so numerous and aimless we don't care. The theme is, well, entirely lacking, so we don't care. Umm, let's see... Oh yes, the casting is so bad we don't care. The greed of the writers and producers was so great in creating this nothing of a soap opera we don't care. I didn't want to finish episode 1, nor 2, nor 3, and now I just shut down episode 7 because, well, they gave me no reason to care. The ONLY reason I am watching all the episodes is because I paid for HBO MAX and want my money's worth. Where by the way is Big Little Lies new series? What happened to HBO? Where is another Soprano's or Rome? What happened to this network? George R. R. Martin, you need to stop counting the money, stop writing, and go into retirement because this is shameless. To be fair though, while awaiting House of Dragons at 9 pm, we watched White Lotus and really enjoyed that series. So, you get a green star."
"When the wire that held the cork gave way all the wokery in the writers' mind finally was released. Right after King Viserys death we see a group of conspiratorial men setting in motion a pre-planned take over, which of course Queen Alicent wasn't aware of, and with which she gets in only because she misunderstood her husband's last words. And because she's a woman, she's a wise and balanced person and will strongly oppose this bloodmongering group of men's plan to killi all their rivals. On the other side, once the black team learn the news, we see a group of unwise, reckless, warmongering men and Princess Rhaenyra being the only prudent, wise and thinking person there trying to stop a bloodshed in the name of her father's legacy. NONE of these portraits and characterizations reflect the books, and needless to say that Daemon getting physically violent with Rhaenyra is also out of character according to the books.We had a great series up to episode 8. Episode 9 was the weakest of the season, and after these biased turning points at the finale, I'm done with this show."
"I was really hoping this would make me forget about the ending of GoT but actually it's just enraged me. This series makes no attempt to address any of the criticisms levelled at GoT, instead it just takes the general vibe of GoT and regurgatates it back to the viewer with the ocassional allusion to the events of the show as fanservice. It's like it was written by a machine who's been fed nothing but GoT episodes. I loved GoT but in my opinion this is a blatant cash grab."
"After the amazing GOT, this is just horrible! I mean, its boring, its all over the place, the acting is subpar... what a disappointment and total downgrading of one of the best TV series in many years. Hollywood is destroying themselves one show after another. Check out the ratings coming out and you will see most are unhappy. You are literally forced to give high reviews to 'ok' tv series and movies because the rest is so bad. Question, why do i have to have so many words to leave a comment. Nobody wants to read a huge paragraph when all they would like to say its, this is good/not good/ok/lousy."
"I wish HoD was not compared to GoT - it doesn't even hold a candle against it. A big budget soap opera at best. The storyline is simple and linear - not complex and multidirectional as with GoT. It tries so hard to satisfy many viewer's instant gratification needs - which creates a very simplistic and predictable storyline - instead of creating an intriguing and complex storyline where the viewer thirsts for more. Throwing in grotesque and gory scenes for just the shock value without proper thought also leaves a lot to be desired. The acting is OK, but character development lacks. The moviesets sometimes seem fake - hidden under dimmed lights. I painfully watched the first season - can't say I am looking for more - sadly!"
"The sudden change from episode Five to episode six is very disappointing. The whole show changed and I feel we lost way to much of the essence of the show. Not sure if it is worth watching anymore. How can jump ten years into the future? The change of actors and actresses is so drastic. We see in episode six that the brother has married and has had a plethora of children, living who knows where, how did he get to where he is, was he banished? Nothing is explained and this is not tying up in any way. How are we the viewers be expect to have an interest in the show? In my opinion, I feel that he producers and directors ave let the fans of the show down."
"The acting is great, but there's no character development in my view. In the pilot of GOT (the first of which had to be thrown in the trash and done from scratch, costing the team a fortune). STARTED with mystery, The individial character's morality, affinity or even duplicity was masterfully fleshed out. The settings FELT real, as well.HOTD is the plar oposite. The large crowds (not really that large vs what GOT had) sounded like 30 people in a sound stage. The sound in general completely lacked in richness. There's no character development to be found either. I felt no empathy for any of the characters (the queen was one exception). The king completely lacked spine for someone who supposedly was a good man. He let his wife be butchered without even giving her a choice of what to do with the birth.The bad guy lacked any intrigue and his character was obviusly a bad guy from the second he appeared. He was a cut & paste, black and white villian. Good actor, cheap character. As others have mentioned, the costumes were just bad. The dragons didn't look nearly as good as the ones in GOT! They didn't even look like they were really flying unlike the astoundingly well-done ones in GOT.I hope they get much better writers (not to mention a better director) .like GOT did BEFORE it even aired. This show was a mistake.as It just wasn't READY to be released. It's just not polished at all. They also need their own Peter Dinklage SO BADLY to carry the story! LOL. None of the characters felt authentic though I do give credit to the actors themselves."
"I will concede production values are good. But the characters are all too serious. What made GOT interesting for me was the mix of characters - good and bad, serious and funny and ridiculous. This show needs a Tyrion, Varys, Little Finger, Bronn or the marvellous Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell, among others, to bring out the sarcastic side of the plot. Hopefully that will come. PS: this edit comes after the second episode. I've lowered the rating from 6 to 4 because it was more stolid and even less witty than the first, if that was even possible. A definite bummer."
Terrible cgi effects and hollow acting.The only ok part of this soap Is the gory combat scenes and the nudity. The wigs and all the Legolas targaryiens are the most boring part. Nobody really cared about them In GOT. But now theyre everywhere. Many scenes looks like hobbit or fantastical beasts. It's so many shady cgi backgrounds that It's hard to get a sense of atmosphere and worldbuilding.
"A big fan of Paddy Considine's East Midlands hard-man schtick, I was gutted to see him playing the King in this show without the distinctive regional accent that we all love him for. Sean Bean shone (briefly) with his Yorkshire brogue in the original series. The only reason I can guess for Paddy not speaking in his legendary Nottingham-ese here, is that American producers feared that fans in the US would struggle to understand it. That mistake has led to an inauthenticity at the heart of this show for which it will be forever punished. The other reason this show fails is the lack of humour. It's just not funny. Boo."
"Disappointing. It's story is the most common king, queen, inheritance, no male heir etc. In the history... Of this world... The only difference between this and some random historical drama is that sometimes we see a dragon for a few seconds... The plot is simple, the characters are one dimensional, no suprises, nothing interesting. I write this after episode 2, not sure if i continue watching... I read that the writer of the Game of Thrones book was overwhelmed how good it turned out... I don't think it's true anymore, unless in the next few episodes something changes radically. I don't know why people give such good reviews to this thing, maybe they were so hungry for a Game of Thrones spin off, that they accept it, no matter how dumb it is."
"If depression were tv series surely the platinum haired house of dragon would be a contender.It feels like the kind of tv that instead of great scripts needed actual content is traded for nudity and shock gore (albeit hats off to costume designers and makeup crew!!!)Story line tired, sad and only chemistry is between the would have been queen and her husband who live on the shores of the sea.This series lacks the teeth and characters found in the other series to be a proper fighter for anyone who enjoys deep storytelling. A lot to be said for lackluster performances.Cheap tricks in trying to keep audiences hooked. Obviously , someone out there loves this and it will continue to be watched. Not worth the subscription."
"I have had more exciting experiences being stuck in traffic. The episodes are slow, largely without excitement and then on occassions teases to be but never delivers. The first three episodes were the best and then it all goes downhill very quickly after that. The worst thing they did was change their best characters and half decent storyline. I seen more excitement in a glass of dissolvable Vitamin C. If you are looking for something like GoT, then rewatch the original series as House of Dragon is like watching a series where the writers have run out of budget, viewers and any good script writing. I would not recommend."
"A friend enjoying this new series convinced me to watch it even though I honestly was not drawn in by the trailers (plus the dragons did not look magnificent to me).All I have to say is that I started watching, and my jaw dropped when it started with a narration. Red flag #1, not that there is no place for it but this one with the opening sequence was just not up to the standard of GoT's. Red flag #2, the actors did not grab my attention. None of them came alive on screen. None felt like the characters they played like the original GoT cast. Red flag #3 was when I stopped half-way through and watched GoT itself. The opening episode of that is FAR ahead of this one. The actors did so well, it still hurts how the show ended but one thing is they made you care and were great from the start. The suspense during the first sequence gets me everytime! This first episode did not make me want to see more."
"I've given 5 stars. It's only the first episode. It may improve. As for these 10 star reviews; bit lost as to how.It's a spin-off on a budget. Which is noticeable, but, understandable.The storytelling isn't to the standard of the GOT 1st episode. Once again. Understandable.As for the casting:Diversity quotas have come in. But! It looks silly. Especially the aesthetic of Lord Velaryon; like sticking a white dude in the Wakanda hordes. And the premise of his character is flimsy. The hair. ðŸ˜„As for the casting of Princess Rhaenyra, she's simply not pretty enough & too small to play that roll. I'm no oil painting, but, come on! This is fantasy! Give us the Targaryen beauty. Okay! Emilia Clarke isn't that tall, but, she is stunning.I started to get bored. IT IS fair to compare it to GOT, because, they have taken on that world."
"If you cant fall to sleep at night, just watch this new series of the one who wrote the last 8 episodes of the worst show ever.Its worse than expected and looks like a low budget serie...dont waste your time.4 for showing breasts."
"These characters are frighteningly trite and uninteresting, not to mention the strained dialogue. The acting has not been strong, especially Matt Smith, but that may have more to do with direction than anything else.The king is a relatively nice guy who wants a male heir. The queen is dutiful and feels guilty. The princess is a cardboard cut-out ""royal teen"" that makes every scene she is in cringeworthy. The brother ""prince"" is a villainous scamp!Just typing this stuff out makes me want to change my rating to a one!The show has failed to interest me, and that's killing me as a fan of the novels and GOT."
"Game of Thrones was so gripping right from the outset; this is just a terrible, generic period drama. It might as well be some am-dram rendition of Jane Austen. It's like they have gone out of their way to make a show and fill it with characters you don't care about and slender suggestions of plot. GoT was full of iconic characters, this is nothing but absolutely a mediocre, terribly acted lazy imitation that things throwing in the odd bit of graphic sex and violence somehow makes it compatible to GoT - it doesn't, and it makes me think that had no idea why GoT worked when they set out to make this. I'm really, very disappointed."
"Big hopes for nothing. This tv show is very disappointed. Worse by each episode. Characters are poor with no charisma like in the GoT. Predictable. Third episode i was feeling like i watched Die Hard! Sad !!Episode three ending was ridiculous. Why didnt Daemon just take out the entire enemy army before. It was as if Leonidas dodged all the arrows, ran down the pass and defeated the entire Persian army. Awful. The show visuals are great but the story is seriously lacking.I hope the next episodes will be better but so far is a total failure! I think they could do vey better.The first episode was so great! But the 2-3 ones were so boring, underwhelming and weak dialogues with uninteresting conversations."
"Episodes 4 and 5 of House of the Dragon were outstanding; I was fully engaged with the tension between Rhaenyra and Daemon and Viserys and Alicent. By comparison, Episode 6 was a confusing letdown diminishing the significance of previous episodes. Set 10 years later, the actors playing Rhaenyra and Alicent were completely different, and IMO were no where near as compelling. The story also left unanswered what happened to Viserys after Episode 5 when he looked Iike he might be dead. And Daemon, who emerged from Episode 4 as a kick ass player, was neutered in this episode.Perhaps, the most disappointing development is with Rhaenyra's character. In previous episodes I was engaged with her. I felt the conflicts in her choices. She was the protagonist of the series. In this episode, she become as unlikeable as the rest of them.Overall, this episode has got me wondering if I want to continue watching the series. GOT was a tour de force. HOTD, until this point, was showing the same promise, but after this latest episode was a letdown."
"I absolutely loved GOT. I watched every episode twice. I was really looking forward for this new series to come out! Listen, it's not awful but it's not great either. I know I can't watch it and compare it to GOT but it's hard not too. I felt like GOT caught my attention right off the bat and kept it for all seasons. I feel the House of Dragon moves too quickly with the plot and doesn't give you time to get to know the characters. The Princess was really growing on me, great actress! And then bam in episode 6 they change a lot of the characters! I watched The Crown so I understand needing to bring in new actors. But for this, I really don't think it was necessary! The new princess does absolutely nothing for me! And I still can't believe that she still went ahead and did whatever she wanted after the awful downfall of the whole Christian thing! Did she not learn from that?! Apparently not! And now he's loyal to the Queen and bad mouths the princess. Dude, it was 10 years ago, move on. But I think the worst of it is how the princess really thought she could pass off her children as her husbands! Umm lady you married a half black man with white hair....your children look nothing like that! Even her oldest son asked if he was a bastard. Before episode 6 I was rooting for the princess but now I'm not. I really hope they make a come back in future episodes."
"The idea was amazing, focus on House Targaryen 100 years before GoT... But seems the writers didn't understand GoT in the first place. It took whole seasons to build up momentum, to get to know characters, to create twists, change of hearts, trusts, alliances, etc... It seems here they are trying to fast forward so quickly to fit 100 years in like 3 seasons or something... It makes the script and screenplay awkward. They are killing the GoT vibe. Why in did they also change the characters in the middle of the first season?? They are also not focusing on building the characters, it just jumps everywhere and they try to be so many things at the same time. I wonder if this is even worse than the last episode of GoT."
I skipped 60% of the last episodes - the set-ups are boring dark and the characters are shallow and not well played. Where is the extra layer of connection between the characters If you compare AOTD with GOT there's no dept in character building and the switch of actress for Rhaenyra is obviously a bad one. Because it was by far the only character that build a tension in her connection with other characters.I started with good hope and liked the first episodes but got bored by the time I was at the 6th episode.The second star is for the members of the team of make-up and hair extensions;) love the long white dreads.
"Way too much unnecessary long and drawn out talk scenes that add little to no value to the story line but in episode seven (7) I kept saying to Ms. Shullivan, ""please King Viserys of Targaryen will you please stop moaning and groaning and just die already."" It was so painful to watch and a complete waste of time.The writers of this season of House of the Dragon suck, and the incestuous relationships and naked rears that keep popping up on a regular basis are insulting to their audience. I prefer to see a strategic story line with evil villains, gullible Kings and Queens and their heirs, loyal gladiators who fight to the death.Instead this season of the House of the Dragon pits a few of the wealthiest manors and families whining and dining with King Viserys I Targaryen while plotting their desire to rule with their dragons who quite frankly are seen flying around the various castles from time to time, and the dragon's unhatched eggs are stolen from one family to the next like a game of hot potatoes.The flame of the dragons was as dismal as the flame in this forgettable series story line and acting.I King Edward frown upon this Kingdom with an abysmal IMDb rating of 4 out of 10 and banish all writers and directors to remove themselves from the Iron throne and move over to a more permanent porcelain throne. Peee Yew."
"No insane person gives this piece of trash 8 ratings.. It doesn't even deserve 1 rating after eposide 5... It seems someone got paid in cash to manipulate ratings.After episode 5, there is no reasons to watch and waste your valuable time. Changes in cast and inconsistent in story line is just sick of this series.. Most ratings were probably done in first few episodes which were consistent with GOT but after change of cast and sick storyline there after -- it's nothing more than opera soap.. Who lame gives 8 ratings for such useless series is beyond human understanding but we clearly know it's a scam done by directors, just earn money by people who paid them in billions to cast in the movie.."
"As soon as I saw the 're-imagined' Iron Throne with all the stupid spikes around it. Ridiculous. Even in a fantasy medieval world I'm pretty sure someone would object to that on health & safety grounds.Even stupider was the fact the king kept cutting himself on the chair and he didn't go 'f this, I'm the king, put some bloody cushioned armrests on this stupid chair.'As for the House Targaryan. If that's how lame they are, no wonder they were usurped.Don't get me started on the bad wigs & woke agendas. Disappointing."
"House of the Dragon is capable matching the technical quality of Game of Thrones. But sadly, it is not capable of providing the excitement which was there while watching GOT.The first episode looked promising. But the show didn't get any better. The casting went so wrong. Neither the characters, nor the actors are likeable. They don't have the charm like the cast of GOT. Remember how we felt when Bran was pushed out the window and the credits started rolling in the very first episode of GOT? That feeling is missing from this. And the sudden jumps in time disrupts the flow of the story.There's no one to root for. I hope it gets better."
"Most weeks episodes since this has started, I'm waiting with anticipation of it kicking in a gear and being interesting! And so far, nothing. I've watched more entertaining news broadcasts than this. Then each week I tell myself one more episode. If it doesn't kick in I won't watch, and each week same thing.Maybe the show directors want to bore us to tears. The lack luster actors, the fact Damon barely speaks is ridiculous. I try not to compare it to GOT but frankly it's pants, and I hate that I'm saying that, but honestly. Kick in a gear because so far I'm staying up to watch it and at 2am I'm bored to tears. Please.. don't make me watch another bore off episode. I want to be entertained, not getting my crocheting out to count my stitches!"
"I was watching this then I decided to multitask because it's just not that interesting. I was hooked from the 1st episode of GOT. But not this one. I am not fascinated by any characters. The whole cast seriously lacks charm except for the prostitute who is so beautiful. But can't imagine she will become a main character in here. The main characters? The princess showed no promise. Why her (the actor)?The plot? Maybe there is something in there but it just doesn't interest me. Hopefully they can turn it around quickly.Overall, un-inspiring characters and uninteresting developments.PS: not a single drop of blood on the ground when wagons of body parts were taken away. Not a great effort on the technology side either."
I found the characters to be lacking the charisma of those in GOT and the storyline so far to be predictable and clichÃ©. The vfx and set design are quite decent but I really felt that episode one was a true waste of my time.
"The grandeur, the spectacle, interesting faces and characters are all missing in the House of Dragons. It is a pale version of GOT. It's just a drab affair festooned with extremely long, boring conversations, feels like I'm watching a daily soap. Don't go by the false reviews. That's usually a ploy these days by producers of movies and tv series, employing people to counteract all genuine negative comments with fake reviews. There is no shock and awe in this series, just a duller version of GOT. In GOT everybody had a defined role, here it is just vague. Producers did not have any new content, just wanted to encash on GOT's popularity and fanbase. I am gradually migrating my viewer time to other interesting series."
"I loved GOT and it absolutely had its instances of gore, but my god...this was just gross. I had stopped watching it after the child birth scene. I feel like the frequent sexual and violent scenes were mainly due to the lack of a solid storyline. I'm really hoping that it gets better but from the 1st episode I'm not expecting much."
"Cant even be bothered.. the main problem is you copied the characters from GOT... faces, hairs, accents, ... nahh.. i wont even bother watching further..as i can already see what will be coming later on... every work should have its authenticity, its own flavor, own characters, shapes, voices, presentation.. just because something worked in the past it doesnt mean we want to see the same thing over and over again, repeatedly... there is supposed to be a thousand y ears or more between this and the GOT, but i see the same faces, well even same actors.. i am sorry but this is an absolute messs...."
"Perhaps they shouldn't have bothered. GoT was a very high bar and anything following it would be expected to try to reach it. This first episode was a let down. Plenty of violence and cruelty, but the storyline fails to grab you."
"I would say, it's a awful TV drama. I'm very much disappointed. It's nothing near to GOT and very very boring and awkward in every prospectives. ."
"Every episodes, it's rushing everything like they have to finish everything by one series which is not actually a bad idea as I'm definitely not going to check out season two if they decide to make one! There are many low budget but quality TV series out there, this one is a rubbish, even quality of the animation is just rubbish! Really have no clue where did they spend so much money on a show which is very poor itself. Even the plots and story itself is not that interesting and very boring."
"I know people really wanted it to meet their expectations, but lets be honest, its a simplistic boring story. Feels like a telenovela staring a teenage girl. The casting is weird and disappointing. The king is naked and no one dares saying it...really not trying to be mean on purpose. Its just complete hot air. No suspense, just a very large budget and a lot of marketing.I know people really wanted it to meet their expectations, but lets be honest, its a simplistic boring story.

"I need, desperately, to care about a character. Can't help but compare it to S1E1 of GoT, when I fell for Jon Snow, Ned Stark & Arya. Plus, the opening scene in that episode grabbed the viewers attention (not to mention the amazing theme song & opening credits, which changed each episode). I felt a little something for Princess Rhaenyra & the King, but that's it. I'll never NOT watch it. I love the genre. But...we'll see. I'll keep an open mind."
"HOD follows the writing decline from 6th season of GOT. The characters are boring and predictable. GOT was complex with many plots and subplots that twisted and turned. HOD has one plot that plods along episode after episode. I gave it a 5 because the production value is great; the design, CGI dragons, wardrobe, etc. Are exceptional. The acting, writing and directing are subpar.My final evaluating criteria is how many times I reach for my phone or tablet during the show because it has become tedious. Episode 6 was 8 times... not good.I'm convinced that the high ratings are directly correlated with the success of the Kardashian's. Simple minds love simple things."
"Oh my god! I am so disappointed from what I have seen so far.Three episodes in and I am completely bored. Where is all the intrigue, diplomacy, erotica, and humour gone?Dreary second rate, characters/actors poorly trying to recreate the tension of the original Game of Thrones. Three hours of who's going to be the next heir and that's about it.To break the monotony of talking about the next heir they throw in some gratuitous scenes and a dodgy CGI dragon flying around burning stuff, to keep the meat heads out there happy.There is not a single character that I am invested in, or rooting for. I simply don't care what happens to any of them. Where are the Tyrion's, Joffrey's, John Snow's, Master of spies, Little fingers etcEverything seems so obvious and done before. I was thinking we would see some new lore but it is very, very samey with the exception of it being much, much more duller.This is such a disappointment so far and I doubt even the excellent Matt Smith will be able to save it.I thought it was me that wasn't feeling it, but both my sons and wife were very meh about it.I will have to keep watching I suppose only to see if this turns out to be the ultimate slow burner but geez so far this is a boring slog of epic proportions."
"Bad writing, phony and stilted dialogue, dislikable characters, and manufactured action scenes do nothing to prop up this boring and unoriginal new series. Everything is paint by the numbers with no creativity or fresh spirit. It's not enough to mask the insipid soap opera underneath the pretty costumes and scenery.On the plus side the actors do their best with the sophomoric writing, with flashes of wry wit here and there. But these are little scraps at a banquet of mediocrity.There are hundreds of better court melodramas in the one hundred plus years of Hollywood history, TV, and streamers. Even some stellar silent epics (with no dialogue) are better written and more engaging than this."
"I'll edit this review as the show progresses. After 2 episodes this show is a real snooze. Nothing happening, no character development, no interesting characters, dragons look awful and fake. Very bland so far, and literally nothing happening. Nobody and nothing stands out. Not sure if these other reviews have watched the whole season in advance somehow or their taste is this bland, not really understanding it at this point. Dialogue is just so uninteresting. A bunch of old men and little girls. And the Prince who I am assuming is supposed to be the badass of the show is very unintimidating. A huge disappointment after two episodes, not close to being on the level of Game of Thrones. Where is the wit? Are these the same writers? Edit: After 5 episodes it's actually gotten worse. Terrible show, terrible writing, awful cast. Does not deserve to be associated with Game of Thrones in any way, nor does it resemble it in any way. These positive reviews have to be bots. Edit: After the season is over. Knocked it down from 3 to 1 star. Really awful, boring, does not resemble Game of Thrones whatsoever. I don't have a single person in my circle that thinks this show isn't awful and boring, no idea where these reviews are coming from. What a farce!!! I hope HBO drops this garbage."
"Well again some idiot somewhere found an ingenious way to destroy a perfectly great show and rip the heart right out of it!Just like that from episode 5 to 6 we jump 10 years forward and viola... a whole big hunk of the cast... is recast! Yeah sorry you lost me! This is worse than Season 8 of GOT.Part of the incredible success of GOT is the perfectly paced character development. We get to watch the youngest of characters not only evolve but literally grow up before our eyes.Yeah I'm done with the show. I can't believe folks talk trash about how House of the Dragon is so much better than The Rings of Power! Ehhh nope. Buh bye HBO, I go off to Middle Earth and leave Westeros far far behind..."
"Given the cast they are working with I'm not sure how it's so wrong.My big problem is I don't care about any of them. In Game of thrones, both the TV show and the books I had characters to love and hate and then change my mind about. This has none, I couldn't even tell you their names.There is nothing to sink your teeth in to, there is no hero, no villain, no love interest and impotent dragons.I understand the idea and the need to carry on the franchise and sometimes it works; Better calk Saul, Frasier to name but 2. This doesn't, we know the history, we know the backstory.Within half an episode of GOT I knew every characters name, 5 episodes in I can't recall 1."
"There is no point in leaving a personal opinion on this kind of show, where hordes of raging, unreasonable fans and misleading production bots rave about this kind of show. If you like gore, nudity, woke diversity pushed down your throat, albinos going berserk and dragons, if you like to fit in with the rest of a social media driven flock, if you kinda despise the activity of thinking, if you are a GOT widow then if you like all these factors all together I strongly suggest you to give it a go. Strong chances you'll love it. For all the others, pass."
"Why is it that Hollywood feels the need to relaunch formerly successful series and halve the average age of the actors? The original Game of Thrones series had some excellent actors ... all of which were way beyond their teens. Not so here. The main protagonists look like they just finished high school, the depth of the dialogues and level of interest this elicits in anyone over 20 is accordingly negligible.This series also follows the current trend of trying to overwhelm the viewer with visually stunning imagery so they forget that the actual story is lame and badly told. Others from this category are Obi-Wan Kenobi and The Mandalorian. Unless you are 14 and enjoy teen drama, stay away."
"Initially, the protagonists were interesting because they were torn, unsure of what was right for them and their families, but after a fast-forward, we find they became the worst version of themselves. Personally, if I don't care about any of the characters enough, to worry if any of them are in danger, it strikes me as a pretty bad sign. The original series was somewhat guilty of this, but there were always some characters who pushed back against the politics and stood for something or played the game in a clever way. Not so much here-they're mostly just self-involved and not motivated by anything terribly interesting, nor acting on those motivations in interesting ways.Considering the series is still airing, it may be at an awkward transitional place- I'll revise this if it switches things up dramatically."
"Losing interest in a the first episode of a new series proves to me I'm not interested. I tried. But found myself doing laundry, looking at my phone, clipping my nails, going to the kitchen. This never occurred during a single GOT episode. I was always interested, entertained, and watched each episode more than once.The casting of Dragons isn't quite right. GOT was perfect. The script? We're paying HBO to be purely entertained by such shows, but they just have to poop in the punchbowl & spoil the fun. The blockbuster popularity Top Gun: Maverick and failure of many others proves what what people truly want. HBO needs to get a clue. But hey, at least there was not a jousting 5 ft nothing, 98 lb female knight beating all the other knights for the favor of a manly princess.I really want another great HBO series to enjoy and so great that I'll buy the DVD collection in the future. But unfortunately it seems they've partially done to GOT with Dragons what was done to Vikings with Valhalla (of which I watched 2.5 episodes & bailed).Time will tell. I've heard the new Hobbit series is absolutely atrocious, a complete woke disaster. So I guess I'll stick with this for a few episodes as there's nothing else new on worth watching."
"Very boring. Very unoriginal. You can watch the first two episodes and already know the story they're about to tell you. The characters have zero charisma and zero identity. Zero motivation too. It's always like you see them many times and still wonder who are they and why they're here at all. Everybody is so generic... Maybe Matt Smith as the prince Daemon Targaryen is a bit better than everybody here but he doesn't really have anything to play here.Overall, very uninspired acting, especially by. Milly Alcock who literally has one face expression for all life situations.Even though the show is clearly weak, the designers did their work just great. Locations, costumes and finally dragons look amazing. If only they had a story... but, unfortunately, it's exactly what they don't have. Especially comparing to the original ""Game Of Thrones"" show."
I suffered through episode 6 but now I'm done watching this disaster. This show needs to be canceled. I actually dislike this even more than the last season of the original game of thrones ... and that is saying a lot. Only reason I watched six episodes was in the hope that HBO might redeem itself from messing up the original show's ending so bad. But no ... OMG ... HBO actually managed to double down on stupidity. Cancel our HBO subscriptions is best way to show what we think about this trash. Boring. Terrible story lines. Do not like any of the characters. Changing the cast now is so stupid as the characters have not aged that much. This is a horrible terrible sad show.
"If you love watching an old man decide whether he should marry a 12 year old child or a 14 year old child then this show is the one for you. If you find that disturbing however, stay clear of it.You won't be missing much anyway. There's like 5 characters with speaking lines and absolutely none of them are memorable. They all feel like bland copies of superior characters we've seen in GoT.The show's politics are laughably juvenile, and considering that's all this show focuses on it's truly impressive how they managed to screw the only thing they decided to focus on so badly.The acting has been fine so far, but nothing spectacular. It certainly isn't able to carry this show on it's own.The first two episodes focus almost entirely on the small council. We very rarely get to see anything else. If you liked the other families and lands besides the Dragon idiots and King's Landing then I'm sorry to say you won't be getting any of them here..."
It's an utterly boring show full of nonsense long and boring scenes. Barely anything exciting ever happens. Just endless boring scenes of drama portrayed in an awful way. It's so slow that after an hour of watching you cannot believe you finished an episode that could've been only fifteen minutes.It's as if the last season of the Game of throne was so satisfying for them so that they decided to produce a sequel to that same repellent season.I simply can not understand the high ratings here. This show is a pure four out of ten in a beyond generous judgment. Do NOT believe the ratings.I'm certainly not waiting for another season of this and nor will recommend it to anyone in a million years......
"I had to really struggle to get through the first two episodes but don't think I'll bother finishing. The acting is weak but the dialogue is even worse - inevitable after tie used to Martin's GOT series. The characters (and casting) are one-dimensional and dull. They all look and sound the same and so it's very obvious what they'll do and say next - you end up not paying attention. Effects, set design and costumes are just average. No sense of scale in scenes or the landscapes. It's basically a low budget remake of the original - worse in every single way. I don't think I'll be wasting any more time on this."
Even early on not one character stands out while in the first series all characters were clearly defined. Nothing about it holds my attention. Sad after waiting all these years. Not bad but not good either. Lame is the best review I can give it.
"I wanted to like this series. But after S1E1, I will reluctantly wait for episode 2. None of the actors grab you in any way shape or form. I feel as if way less effort was put into this series perhaps with the expectation of riding on coat tails of GoT. This was tough to make it through! I hope it gets better. It can't get much worse for an opening episode of this new series!"
"There is no way that anyone can honestly rate this show a 10. It's so boring and uninspired. There isnt a single actor with any charisma. Like watching paint dry and the 2nd episode is even worse then the first.Having a 15 year old girl as one of the protagonists isnt appealing in the slightest. I would have said the exact thing if it was a 15 yr old boy. Plus the pedophilic undertones made it uncomfortable to watch. Having the king romancing another young girl and then considering marriage to a 12 year was so awkward to watch. The scene with the king and the 12 year old girl literally made my skin crawl.Lets not even mention when the princess made Daemon back down was laughable. No man or group of men would ever take a 15 year old girl or boy seriously. We call them children for a reason and we treat them as children for the same reason.Comparing this to GoT is ridiculous.The great thing about the fantasy genre is we can create great myths, legends and heroes. This show has none of those elements.Who can you possibly root for in this show? No one far as I can tell."
"First of all i want to say that though i wish i could rate this series as a standalone series not related to GoT, i cannot. They used the same title song and intro as GoT, which i think is bad because this show is nothing like GoT. I would say this show feels more like The Tudors with dragons.They are missing the great and fun characters like tyrion, bronn, brienne, samwell, podrick, jaime etc. Those characters provided contrast to the brutish world that was made in GoT. If you laugh one moment and get shocked by sex/torture/awe the next it has much more impact. It now feels like just another brute soap with a large sum of money behind it. As a male i am not interested in another soap about a royal family even if they have dragons(which i normally like)I would never thought i would say this of a GoT spin-off but i think i am not even gonna watch more than the 4 episodes i've watched so far. GoT was immediately compelling. This is a show with bad pacing, it is boring a lot of the time + the not very likeable characters. It's a shame it could have been so good if they held on to the GoT premise and feeling."
"The first episode leaves the impression of an incredibly low budget game of thrones that is poorly cast with a script that has no soul. The CGI feels very cheap and dragons don't come close to giving that impressive feeling that Game of Thrones really did do so well.As other reviews have pointed out, the hair looks pretty stupid on some characters, not a huge deal but it compounds with the fact that a lot of the costumes for one reason or another look wildly unrealistic. For example Daemon Targaryen's helmet and armor REALLY looks like spray-painted plastic that weighs absolutely nothing. The already pretty dull fighting scenes feel even poorer when some guy is jousting in plastic armor.The only action-packed section of the episode is interrupted every 10 seconds (not an exaggeration) by shots of a gruesome childbirth. Why they felt the need to mash the two sequences together; I have no idea, but frankly it left me wondering what kind of person actually wants to watch this series. So far it just feels like it's building up to be lackluster drama series about a teenage girl with dragons - which is fine if that's your thing.I could probably overlook all this if it wasn't for the undeniable fact that not a single character in the episode is even remotely likable. The main character is a young girl who has the same look on her face the entire episode except when she's crying. I'm not sure if her character was intended to have other emotions, or if we are even supposed to like her."
"This skips forward in time with no rhythm or competency. You are expected to infer huge story arcs without any subtext or follow though. It's lazy, so incredibly, incredibly lazy from the writers.Glossing over huge plot points and potentially interesting sub plots. It is mind-numbingly infuriating and so saddening. I can only imagine the writers just have utter contempt for the audience.I have made it to episode 6 and I am unable to give it a minute more of my time. So disappointing, this has fallen so short of the mark.You were given the keys to the kingdom and you have squandered it so willingly. Shameful."
"One of the biggest disappointments of the year. To call it a Prequel to the Legendary Game of Thrones is an absolute insult to Game of Thrones. This one is Poorly Scripted, Acted and Directed. It just meanders along with no Pace at all. At times you have to really try hard not to doze off. A crashing bore to say the least. Script has no content and substance to engage the audience. Most of the scenes are just random or a Red-herring which could have been easily avoided.Finally VFX is also of poor quality unlike GOT which was simply brilliant in that department. All in all a massive letdown !!"
"Episode 7 is as the ones before it, a drag to watch... Failed to connect with characters; soap operatic dialogue; illogical timelines; forced meaningless relationships and an unconvincing plot; and bad acting.It felt like I was forcing myself to watch each episode and none of the events of the episodes would stick to memory, forcing me to repeat the last episode to try connecting with each new one.I worked up enthusiasm by recalling GoT to justify spending watching HoD. Wondering if the producers were thinking the success of GoT would carry the series forward; well, it didn't. It's a pity, really.RIP GoT, a once in a lifetime fantasy series, I fear."
"The series is plain boring. There is no emotion what so ever. The characters have no goals and are very poorly written for screen. It's all about who married who, but where GOT made that nail-bitingly interesting, HOTD makes it painful to sit through.It would've been more interesting if there were more fights and dragon battles, something one would expect from the title of the show and from reading the book.The characters don't go through any development, despite the plot jumping years ahead in the storyline. It is very boring and one could easily tap away at their phone while watching. To be honest, I feel like this show would discourage people who haven't seen GOT to watch even one episode."
"Even though this is set in the same world, everything is different.You can tell from episode 1 that the directors are trying to film it the same but it comes off bad.The cast is absolutely TERRIBLE. The main protagonists and the queen being the worse.For being the house of the dragon there is barely... dragons. Sounds crazy but it is true. We saw way more after Daenerys had them than here, but all of them were alive.Some scenes are brushed over while others, with little to no importance, are long shots. The very essence of GOT it is not here, when people are looking to find it.This is SO disappointing. So far it is a 5/10."
"HBO should remake season 7,8 and give it 13 seasons as GRRM suggested instead of doing this. They destroyed our most loved and an amazing tv series GOT and destroyed Dany who had so many background story, love and potential. It was all for nothing. Instead of working this new thing thats not even good, they should give the original story an ending we deserved, the continuation that the writer suggested. I know that different team is working on this. However, if HBO desperately wants to make ""Thrones"" series, fix the original story. Giving us an unbelievably rushed and horrible ending for GOT and releasing whatever this is and expecting it to succeed? Nah i gave up on this show couldn't even finish it too boring and slow."
"Why is everyone looking so boring? There's not one good looking character in a franchise that gave us sansa, jon, denaerys, no face man, jaimee, viper... so many of them looked a treat to the eyes. Even the extras in GOT looked better than the leads here.The acting is substandard. The dragons are reduced to just props. The outfits look more modern than last years fashion and just don't look the part at all.Most importantly, the plot is wafer thin. Where are the sudden rampant twists that GOT was so famous for?The set is basically a wall next to a tree, a courtyard shot in ten different angles and a court room that feels like leftovers of the old set."
"What a monumental disappointment.The characters have not gravitas. The king speaks in a bored monotone. The princess looks bored, aloof and alas not very pretty. The kings brother (Matt Smith) is entirely miscast. There doesn't seem to be a compelling story here. Why did they not instead make a series of the prequel novel A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms which has a solid main character and story? Whereas the original series action moved at a gallop, the pacing here is barely a trot. I am half way through episode 2 and still nothing has happened. The Hand of the King (Rhys Ifans) manages to make something of his character, but the weak script leaves his performance hollow."
"Season 1 is so boring, all talk and barely any action. The characters doesn't feel like they have complexity. It would be fine if this season was a season to just build up the characters or story but conflicts came and went without much build up and resolution, the timeline also jumps so dramatically between episodes it makes it feel like whatever happened in the last boring episodes doesn't matter anymore.Daemon killing his wife Rhea was so pointless to me. They introduced a new character just to kill them off in less than a few minutes. I didn't feel like it advanced Daemon's character or the story. And the actress playing Rhea wasn't even ugly, if it's only going to be a few minutes wasted, at least align it with the story.And switching two main actors mid season is so disengaging, I could not mentally buy-in that young Rhaenyra is the same as older Rhaenyra."
"I had quite high expectations for this show, although like many others, I was left very disappointed by the conclusion of GoT.However, I always liked Daenerys and her story. The first episode was still quite promising but then things started going downhill.For one, this show sometimes skips ahead by several years leaving potentially important developements in that time out. The main characters are really bland (Rhaenyra and Queen Alicent). Daemon is pure evil and just goes around killing and destroying things. The last episode offererd antother serving of pure and unnecessary violence that just looks horrible.In GoT there were so many characters and storylines that it was sometimes hard to keep up. Here, the cast is dull and the story is boring AF.I won't be continuing the show."
"From hideous dragons to senseless plots House Of Dragons have it all. Not sure what the writers are trying to do. Just for the sake of making things. Senseless plots, unnecessary long scenes with no impact, seems like trying to do too much and lost about every sense of story telling. As if the intro video with blood all over wasnt enough. Every episode seems like a different season or tv show all together. How can anyone have interest in watching it. Who gave this a 8+ rating? Must be kids who are rating this and waiting for a week and watching this cartoon show. I Hope it doesnot have a second season. Just a waste of good talent and money. Horror series."
"It's a one hour long episode and nothing really happens. I just started multitasking several times, I was that bored.The CGI... Some shots are OKAY. But why did we get like 5 dragon scenes? If there is such a thing called gratious nudity, there should be a thing called gratious dragon shots. There was not point for but one dragon scene in the entire episode. They could have saved the budget of the rest to spend on other special effects stuff... And there was a need for spending more on those... The background CGI shots are atrocious. ATROCIUS. They look like something straight out of a history docu TV series about the Roman arenas in the late 2000s. It is that bad. And alas those filters! You can't properly see the Red Keep from those bloody lens flare like filters!And Daemon's armour looks like cheap plastic. Speaking of Daemon... When Alfie Allen was told he would have to go nude in Season 1 of GoT, he decided to hit the gym to get in shape. Matt Smith obviously didn't get the memo. He should've kept the clothes on, not just because he was not looking aesthetically pleasing, but because I simply don't believe that a body like that can hold full armour plate, move and fight in it.The characters are utterly boring. I'm not rooting for anyone. Anyone. Otto Hightower is like a mixture of budget Tywin and budget Littlefinger. Rhys Ifans, an otherwise superb actor, simply cannot make him intimidating nor interesting. And honestly, lacklustreness goes for almost every other character as well... Remember how in Got, even the side characters were interesting and nuanced? Scrap that. Lord Corlys Velaryon and the princess' bodyguard are the only characters I have any curiosity for at this point...The worst offender though is the utter lack of compelling dialogues. You konw, the thing that made GoT SO good. It is absolutely not present in this show.AND THOSE WIGS ARE HORRIBLE."
"It was slow paced then started getting interesting a bit. Then came episode six, 10 years later. Became confusing and main characters has different actors now. Just can't connect. Story changed, no clue as to what happened between those 10 years. I'm afraid I have lost intrest in the show and that is unfortunate. Just soooomany things don't make sense. But changing actors we have become connected to just doesn't seem lime a good move. Very bad move. As others have said, it really does seem like a soap opera, not much action anymore. I may give another episode a chance for the wife only because she wants the next episode to redeem it. We will see."
Ok. It's early so all of the first reviews coming in will be from a lot of fanboys and will be very inflated. Here's the truth.Cons:
"The casting is awful.The script is forced and rushed.The acting is subpar.The character development is mediocre at best, it has a very United Nations vibe, very much trying to cast all races just for the sake of it.It's gorey for the sake of being gorey. The nude scenes also aren't well done, very rushed.Pros:"
"Music is well done.Set locations are again very well done in keeping with the GoT themes, they obviously spent a ton of money here in set production.I'm hopeful but not optimistic. I'll keep watching for a few more episodes but so far this first episode was horrid except for the final 10 mins, but, it wasn't enough to clear the bad taste out of my mouth. So far this series has a vibe of ""throw tons of money at it and everything should be fine"". But it's not."
"They had the budget, a good script material, a fantastic brand and we end up with a serie B type of series.The casting director did a terrible job: actors are either bad or simply don't fit at all with their characters. This is the most drastic downgrade versus GOT.In terms of pace, this is very difficult to follow with years gaps between episode, but despite the crazy fast forward abuse, it is sadly slow and boring. In 6 episodes, very little is happening except the change of actors to incarnate aging characters (change for the worst btw).Lastly, to create some ambiance, they decided to shoot in dark which makes it very difficult to watch."
"So far, definitely a case of style over substance.Episode two begins, suprisingly, with the an updated mix of the same theme tune. So.. This is just another episode of GOT? Seems odd as the visuals are as good as any but it's supposed to be a prequel but everything seems cleaner and more up to date. There are good actors here, it's nice to see Paddy Considine with a lead roll but the script is over-used cliche after cliche. The strangest thing for me is that this world seems hollow and well within its boundaries which is to say there is nothing outside of this world as opposed to GOT which had a large geographic scale and a large bunch of characters. This makes HOTD feel more like a soap opera (with gore and nudity)... Will give the third episode a try but I am already losing interest. Eppisode was also painfully slow..."
"Written to make money, it shows and it ought to fail.Shameless exploitation of a once good idea. Cast of nasty characters doing nasty things in ways that neither reveal nor reflect human truths. Can't even see how this is catering to a ""perceived desire"" of the actual audience. Not even consistently good production values, it regularly resorts to an almost black screen, and all the incredible make up talents that can age actors seem to have been cast aside creating a ridiculous discontinuity with new actors playing some of the lead roles.There is gore and violence for its own sake, a kind of violence porn that degrades TV and degrades us, and the very opposite of the kind of realism that was shown in eg. Saving Private Ryan.In summary shame on those involved. A real disappointment after the first 7 series of Game of Thrones (ignoring the last of course)."
"Everything about this show is uninspired - the plot is singular and painfully obvious, the actors for the most part are simply reading the lines they are given. The decor and CGI reminds of a theater play, the costumes are too clean, too tidy. The dragon riding scenes are hilarious and the creature design is for the most part unrealistic (especially compared to GoT).Additionally the show does the gravest mortal sin of cinema - time jumps and this is done with the use of actor changes, instead of make-up/dress-up ageing. It is quite jarring and is done for the sole purpose to fill the show with some form of content, given how the plot is literally watching paint dry. If this was GoT imagine instead of the first season, we were given the entirety of Robert Baratheon's reign where nothing happens and he just drinks and squanders the treasury. Come to think of it it would probably be more enjoyable that this...whatever this is."
"I've been watching several episodes and really fought hard giving this a chance hoping something would eventually grow on me, some character or the story itself. Sadly I've come to the point that I must realize that this is a very pale and shallow shadow of the original game of thrones. There's no clear plot, the characters all lack charisma. If the main plot here is adultery and incest which so far seems to dominate the story, well, then it's not for me but considering the positive reviews and its high IMDB rating it seems there is a vast target group for such content. Sadly the magic is totally gone here."
"Of course expectations are incredibly high regarding any prequel, sequel or movie related to Game of Thrones. House of the Dragon falls way below par by any fan's standards. After experiencing the luxury of great actors with charisma plus superbly written characters placed in highly dramatic situations (Game of Thrones) this show clearly has none of that. The leads are dull and the groups of folk wearing fake looking white wigs gives the production a boring mono chrome vibe. Also, the pointed violence and sex scenes add more meaninglessness to this crass, market-motivated debacle. This is absolute poo and I'm giving up at 3/4 way through episode 1."
"Its more or less impossible to beat out that first cast of GOT. This lot of pikers cant hold candle to the likes of ""Spider"" Tyrion, Jamie,Arya,Cersei, Tywin ,Hot Pie, Theon , and his sister and RAMSEY BOLTON .The casting director needs to be hung from the yardarm, there are some fabulous actors out there, why this crew ??This also seems like a cut rate production, WITH ALL THE MISTAKES of the first series looming already.Read the books , they are much better than this twaddle."
"Okay, lead actors change has happened with The Crown as well, but at least they did it in between seasons and it was somewhat expected. The unexpected 10-year jump is coming out of the blue and looks like an artifact of the need to change actors.The fact this wasn't disclosed and you just discover this by surprise is a silver lining of how HBO treats their customers. And this was THE most advertised and expected show in their network, but despite that the very first season is mismanaged.If actors aren't important to you for some reason, this is an interesting story, but I found nothing more but a disappointment and my time wasted."
"Only preteens and oldies live in kings landing, no charisma, bad storyline. So disappointed. No political schemes, everything is predictable and feels like a cheap copy of got. All the great reviews you read here must be fake, I wont watch another episode."
"Music and production is obviously great, But my biggest problems:"
"1. The Recast: for a show that is gonna be pushed for headline you could've done something else rather than recasting so the investments in a character wouldn't go to waste, Why is this important? The performance of an actress or actor defines the character and It's almost impossible for two actors to do the same exact performance, after all the actor is the one making the script alive, They could've start with the final characters and then had flashbacks, In this way the transactions would be way more smooth.2. Absence of Interesting characters: In GOT we had a lot of characters that I would be really vouching for them to not die and some of them ended up dying which added value to the show but In this show I'm absolutely OK with all of the characters dying, In fact I wish more of them die so less time would be wasted on these stupid characters but some how doe to the great writing they end up alive specially in the end of episode 9 I was so happy at first and then she just left and I couldn't be more mad at the stupid lazy writing.3. Things that just make no sense: there are a lot of times that I'm like WT(absolute/actual/literal/etc)F was that, for example the foot fetish thing how does that add any value? Specially revealing it in a very serious time, Or in episode 9 when the king walks in with the most dramatic and beautiful music(which by the way I think the music is too good and it doesn't match with the writing that is awful) is played for and nothing really important happens and he goes back."
"From the very beginning I was disappointed, and confused. The acting is generally really bad. There was only 3 actors, that shined from the very beginning, and sadly two of them was replaced because of the timeline. The young princess, the young queen, and the brother to the King. The rest of the cast is ill instructed, and are very overplayed, and very boring. Nothing is subtle, or between the lines, like we are used to from GOT - everything is talking heads, and theatrical scenery. No one is likeable, or charming, besides those three. The young princess is gives the impression of a real Targaryen. Very beautiful, strong mind, and charismatic - like we got used to with the 'mother of dragons'. However, she was replaced by an actress with no resemblance, charm, or acting skills. Also the character has changed so much, that it is unrecognizable, without proper explanation - at which we got none. She went from strong, and charming - to a weakling, and birth-machine. The young queen also made a 180 from episode, to episode - from being likeable, and caring, to a very negative person, who is capable of all kinds of evil. There are no history in these transitions of character. Also everything is rushed, and often they make these scenes at which they attempt to be clever, and show it all at once. However, these scenes are childish, and very poorly done. Even the scenes that have some substance in them, are suddenly drowned it cliche. A very bad attempt to make a prequel to one of the most epic stories ever told - a waste of time."
"Why does this show move so fast? You have 172 years to fill. Between one show there is a missing wedding then a 2 year old and a kid on the way? Then we just see Rhaeyrna brooding ... can we get some lead up there? You started with a narrator, why did you abandon that story technique? Just seems so rushed when you have the audience who is going to watch!Also, trivial stuff left and right. Daemon steals the egg to just let it go when his cousin shows up on a smaller dragon than he has and speaks valayrian? What?! And then wake a baby? Who is writing this ? Hope it improves. I really want to get into it but where is the action, or at least the drama and suspense?"
"I'm not sure it's even worth bothering to list the many disappointments I felt watching this series. This does a disservice to GOT enthusiasts and the criticisms I have read so far have mostly been spot on.From the beginning episode, this failed to lay out an understandable foundation for the rest of the series. The script was written to portray context mostly through innuendo leaving the viewer to try to ferret out a character's thoughts or intentions. This type of delivery should not be used as the bulk of a storyline but sprinkled about to add mystery and interest.The jumps in time, without explanation, were jolting and disjointing. It felt like a much larger version of the script had chunks pulled out to make it fit the episode count.The characters often felt superficial as the writing did not give much occasion for the actors to engage the audience.The Cinematography was uneven and dark scenes were muddy. It was feast or famine which again disrupted smooth transitions between scenes.There was some standout acting but it was overshadowed by much that was mediocre. I never really connected with the characters as I struggled to find a consistent interesting thread that wove the pieces together. The underpinnings I did recognize were commonplace and showed little imagination.The whole production came across as rushed almost as if they really didn't plan on this series getting many new seasons. It felt like an exercise in how artful a production could be made rather than stitching meaningful, engaging segments together into whole cloth.In the end, this did not match the quality of GOT so I was extremely disappointed. I can only surmise that the dragons, violence and sex fueled the higher ratings."
"I've now watched up to episode 6, and I'm so bored. Up to now could have been covered in a star wars style pre crawl. Every episode is an hour longish and nothing happens! Now there is plenty of shows where this is also true but is full of tension and great character interactions that still push through the story. Not here. And that's not to take away from the performances, some of which are great (Rhys Ifans) and some (Matt Smith) which are being blown way out of proportion. I get world building, but guys, this is a spin off! World is built already! I thought after the first 5 episodes had established the story and we had the time jump and recast the characters things might start moving but no, still plodding away. Spending too much of the budget on pointless dragon scenes and none on the actual script doesn't make for a good show. And why some of the cast have been aged up and some of the excellent performers have been replaced entirely makes no sense, until you realise they spent too much on uneccessary cgi dragons that there was no funds left for the make up department. Extremely disappointed, especially as I was hoping this would help redeem GOT season 8."
"I was going to give this show 9 or even 10. Until I got to the 6th episode. Now I had to cut it in half since they massacred the rest of the show from one episode to the next. I would really like to know who took this shockingly stupid decision that ruined the entire show. How on earth could one come up with the insane idea to replace the two lead actresses halfway into the season because of a simple 10 year jump ahead, and at the same time NOT replace most other actors... A little less hair and some extra wrinkles on the king, and absolutely nothing changed on for example Daemon and Cristos. Cristos didn't even get a single gray hair, not even in further time jumps.We can do wonders with make-up today. There was absolutely NO REASON to replace any actors at all. But what made it even more insane was to replace two leads and NO-ONE ELSE. And basically nothing changed on the ones left. Why would someone make such a stupid decision? There was amazing chemistry between the original actresses, both between each other and between the other actors. There is absolutely no chemistry between the new actresses and the original actors. None. The first 5 episodes were practically fizzing with chemistry and energy. Come episode 6 and all the magic is gone. So sad. Completely slaughtered the show.I've seen a lot of stupid mistakes and bad decisions in film and tv series through the years, but this is by far the worst. Seriously, they should remake the show with the original actors. That's the only thing that can bring back the magic and do justice to this story."
"Nothing new to see here. This show has zero creativity or originality. The show is so creatively bankrupt they even used the SAME SONG as game of thrones. I've never seen a spin off do that before, as if to remind you ""Hey remember that thing you liked before, please like this too"" At it's best it's almost half as good as season 8 of GOT. There's no likeable characters and there's no one to root for. I don't care who dies and who wins, they can all die and I wouldn't feel anything for any of them. There's no interesting plot lines, everything feels stilted or forced. The makeup and CGI are distractingly bad. The were wood tree is like shockingly cartoons CGI. Even the cinematography is flat and boring. This show is resting on the laurels of GOT, which was already damaged goods with it's deeply flawed last two seasons. The actors are not bad, but I feel like they're suffering from lack of direction. The whole thing kind of has that flat ""Star wars Prequel"" kind of vibe. No one is very convincing and the world isn't immersive like it was in GOT. The more the characters develop the less I like them. The battle scenes are painfully stupid, like Michael bay levels of stupid. GRRM wrote really cool realistic battles, that's part of what made ASOIAF so cool. None of that is present here. Daemon might as well be Captain America with the way he charges in and kills guys while no one can hurt him until it serves the plot, then somehow he can still around around like arrows in his leg. They really seem like they're trying to create a Marvel cinematic universe with game of thrones and the whole thing just reeks of corporate ""product"" there's no passion or vision here. It's just a product for the lowest common denominator. The 4th episode was the final nail in the coffin for me, it's just boring and when it's not boring it's dumb,"
"As usual, excessive political correctness bedevils shows made since around 2000+.I was hoping this show might be an exception but it isn't. No good shows are being made any more.I've seen the first episode only, and the show doesn't have the heart and soul of the first four seasons GoT. (The last 4 seasons of GoT were less successful, with the final season... The final season of GoT was absolutely terrible.The entertainment industry is broken. It fails to entertain these days.I wish I had more to say about this show, but it's so empty, noting much stands out. GoT seasons 1 to 4 were so great, nothing else compares."
"The dialogues are very long, and most of the time the characters during the two episodes are stuck on the table, it's like a stage show, and the actors had nothing to work with.The story and if it exists, it hasn't started yet!! Nothing there. Are you sure there is a story, events, suspense, cities, or kingdoms? Because I watched two completely empty episodes. I'm not sure why they decided to make earlier parts instead of a sequel that would have been a lot better, maybe Jon Snow would be a better show maybe.Lots of dialogue that didn't contribute to the story or move it forward. But there was no story to get interested in."
"The ratings for this production only prove that today's audience lacks any ability to appreciate the qualities that make film or tv memorable.Imagine season 8 of GOT minus the two great battles sequences and the very acceptable end. That would be still be a presentation well above the slop the Martin and company launched as the House of the Dragon.I was never interested ti the history of the families or of Westros inGOT, rather it was in the characters, cast, dialogue, stories, dragons and atmosphere of the story.Remarkable depth was accomplished in virtually every storyline with my interest always piqued by the interactions of the characters.What appeared in HOTD was a polar opposite of everything I admired in GOT. Remarkably flat in every way. Looks like a fourth rate copycat version of GOT. The dragons will have to be really terrific to make this garbage even watchable."
"A lot of reviews here have already covered what is awful about this show, but to sum it up; tedious story, mediocre characters who it's impossible to care about, and the entire show (as expected) just tries to ride on the coat-tails of GOT, right down to just recycling the theme tune. The garbage casting does nothing to help either. Prince Phillip AKA Matt Smith as Daemon is just horrendous. Impossible to take seriously, and looks ridiculous with his wig on.The dialogue has none of the sharpness or same depth as before, the set pieces are in your face in places and feel forced and artificial, the cringe ""love"" interests and resulting stories are just so flat and utterly dull.Don't waste your time with this one. It sucks."
"House of the dragon has nothing that made GoT so appealing and attractive. There is just one single storyline, no shocking events, no drama, no characters to identify with, no mysteries, no battles, no violence, no sex, no mysticism, nothing at all. Nothing to like, nothing to be puzzled or intrigued by. I only watched through episode 6 out of a misplaced sense of loyalty towards GoT.Acting is poor and flat, photography at times a disaster (half of episode 5 and 6 I couldn't even see what was going on) and direction is that of an amateur. If you have the opportunity to show the glory of Harrenhall before it was destroyed by dragon's fire, then please do! A two-second shot is not enough.Nobody can take this seriously. Let's hope that the showrunners will come up with some sort of punchline in the end: ""Haha, we fooled you into getting a subscription to HBO! Got you (!)."" I could appreciate that."
"HOTD is 175 years BEFORE GOT, yet HOTD looks and feels more advanced and less primitive than GOT. It should be the other way around. Paddy is very good actor but he is extremely poor in this show. There is so much dead time during the course of the first 2 episodes where the actors just stare at each other or off in the distance. The dialogue feels forced and the script is poor. The first episode of GOT had you sucked in immediately and the characters were developed just as quickly. It does feel like this show is on a seriously low budget. The CGI isn't great but the dragons look pretty good. HOTD is more like a soap opera. I'm very disappointed, but I'm hoping for a change in the action soon."
"It looks like it's a cheap knock off of the Game of Thrones original series,the acting is terrible. At the end of the 1st episode it leaves me indifferent."
"Lol. You know who had a an arc ? GOT , sorpanos, true detective. If HBO is looking to hire writers to rewrite this great show of Game of Thrones, in which this crappy ass show has no business playing the music of, I'll be gladly to apply as a writer. These writers need to be fired immediately. So to the producers, they need to get the old directors and producers of Game of Thrones.It's like why even say the show is based off of Game of Thrones? Why even play the introduction music? Like my one of my favorite characters from the Sopranos says. Which by the way is on the same net work there's good and there's not good and this is not good. Why? For reasons we possibly couldn't interpret or quantify. The writing sucks the directing sucks. The acting is OK. The evil albino brother is OK and so is young girl. This shows storyline sucks. And I need to bring back the old executive producers. The show needs to do a complete 180 for season two. Otherwise I predict the show get canceled. Not trying to hate on the show either. I love Game of Thrones. I love the Sopranos. I loved her detective. I love everything that each pill has to offer. Except the show. The show is absolutely terrible. There's no way that these reviews are accurate. Read all my reviews in the highest I gave was like a seven. Thank you very much. Much."
"This show had so much potential but there are just too many issues. I will list them below without spoilers.1. There are no consequencesThe characters face basically no consequences for their actions which make ultimately no difference to the plot. This is a complete contrast to Game of Thrones (when it was good) which had a dire and logical consequence to every decision taken by every character. There is a massive disruption to a coronation. Zero consequences. There is a murder in the King's hall. Zero consequences. There is a brutally violent murder during a wedding. Zero consequences. There is a murder of a wife. Zero consequences. There is a murder in the Queen's council. Zero consequences.2. The characters are passiveEven main characters tend to do nothing for YEARS to advance their position or achieve their goals. Daemon should be an incredibly interesting, dynamic rogue and charismatic leader who plots and acts, but instead he does nothing and has absolutely no plan.3. Male characters are completely redundantI don't know if it's due to wokeness but the male characters are the most passive of all and do nothing to advance their goals. The King does nothing. He doesn't even appear to have any goals. Daemon does nothing. The Sea Snake does nothing. The Hand essentially does nothing. The new Hand definitely does nothing. The young male characters do nothing.4. Multiple characters have absolutely no part to play in the plot and are included for no reasonThere are many characters throughout the story that have absolutely no impact on events at all. There is a female spymaster called The White Worm who lives in the poor district of King's Landing who achieves nothing and does nothing and is of absolutely no consequence whatsoever, for example. There is a maester introduced in episode 10 that does absolutely nothing. The young characters are of no real consequence. They fight and it doesn't matter. The Sea Snake's entire family is basically pointless and has basically no bearing on the plot. A princess that's meant to be a main character does nothing of consequence.5. The time jumps create a lot of problemsI know the point of the show is about succession and dynasty over the course of time, but because of the time jumps we form no real attachment to any of the characters. It also causes many pacing issues. The pace is usually either painfully slow or jarringly fast. It also introduces new characters (minor ones) in the last episodes that we have not formed any attachment to.6. MoralityGeorge RR Martin does lots of moral grey areas and he does it very well. However, in GOT, there were clear good guys (the Starks etc) and clear evil guys (Cersei, Joffrey, the White Walkers, etc) and you knew who to root for. In this show, no one is particularly good, and no one is particularly bad (apart from the terribly shallow and one-dimensional character of Aegon who is more of a parody than a real character). Because of the lack of clear morals, it's hard to care about what happens or form any allegiance to any characters.7. The dialogueA minor issue, but in many scenes the dialogue is clunky, obvious, on-the-nose, and spelling things out for an audience that the writers clearly think is stupid. GOT (before the last two seasons) had far more subtle and interesting dialogue which had real undertones and subtext. This show has none of that depth at all.8. The dragonsThey're not a problem, they're just not that interesting and ultimately also of basically no consequence. We don't see characters bonding with them or caring about them. It would have been far better to see this. There's a great dragon chase scene. It would have been even more impactful to actually have seen a bond being built between the riders and the animals.9. There are times when the plot makes no sense at all.There are certain times when you have to ignore realism and logic completely. There is a moment when a mother sends her son of about 11 off to be her envoy while she and her entire family are in mortal peril then learns what happens to her son when there's no possible way she could have found out. There are many other examples of this where the writers don't want you to think about anything you're watching. Just consume and be mindless.So that's it. I wanted to love this show, and thought it might finally be some kind of redemption for the absolute trash that were the final seasons of GOT. But sadly no.I'm giving it 5 stars because the visuals are good and it started well in the first few episodes. Also, I suppose there's another season to come which might improve it. But I won't be watching."
"If this is what to expect from the writers, perhaps it's time to shelve this as well as GOT.After they all got lazy for the last two seasons of GOT, did they move on to this drivel?!!None of the characters were likeable enough to draw one in.One good thing I should mention is the FX. I think the dragons look pretty realistic, for dragons. Lol"
"I was watching the 6th episode, waiting and waiting, for something to happen, just seemed to be at a total standstill. There are a few action sequences here and there, but, they are few and far between.Is this what premium television has become?The utter lack of a story that holds one glued to the TV doesn't exist with ""House of the Dragon"", in fact, its the opposite, it drives you away."
"The GoT gave us a glimpse into the brutal life of medieval times. The cinematography helped as it was clear , raw and as visceral as the plot.Unfortunately HotD is blurry and unconvincing in most aspects. Perhaps it will improve ( I got as far as halfway through episode 5 and have given up on it for the time being.) CGI is a curse if done badly. I feel as though one of the characters will get a light sabre out soon.This is more fantasy than grounded brutal GOT.If you liked Avatar this is for you. Personally I can't find a character to warm to and the neither do I find any of the darker characters fleshed out enough to be believable.I'll leave it a while before I dip my toes back in the water."
"I know I am not a critique, but hear me out, everyone else grew older in the 6th episode because they took a huge time jump, anyway kudos to the makeup artists but am I the only one who thinks they forgot about Fabien Frankel aka sir Christen Cole? That dude looks exactly the same from the first episode itself, his beard is shaped better than mine, I'm commenting on this because I don't think shaping one's beard was the fashion choice in the mediaeval times.Also, this guy CAN NOT ACT. PERIOD.His face is all expression less he moves his head a little too much, I mean I get it that he's pretty but he always looks like he saw a ghost."
"The production values are on par with GoT but that's where the similarities end. 3 episodes in and the only remotely likeable character is the princess. There's no story other than backstabbing politics and as my review title says, unnecessary violence and cruelty. I barely made it through the c-section scene insterpersed with the city watch mutilating citizens. The honourless killing of that deer in ep 3 with them clapping afterward was just too much. Chuck in some nasty medical shots and you've got yourself a show according to George RR Martin.I have to wonder what kind of sick mind thinks this is entertainment. GoT was violent yes, but it felt somehow more grounded and the way things were at the time. House of the Dragon has taken all of those worst qualities in Game of Thrones, removed their balancing elements, and given us a show that's all talk and cringe."
"Another dime a dozen fantasy where writing is mediocre and the main characters play idiot ball to further the plot.Main characters running trough entire armies alone and through rains of arrows without getting killed. That's the opposite of what I would hope from a Game of Thrones spin off.Don't expect anything great, but it's a fine show to just tune in and watch. Action is decent. Dialogue and acting if fine, writing overall is just very poor.I went in hoping for a second Game of Thrones and was dissapoitend. If you go in expecting a okay-ish fantasy show with a high budget, you should be fine."
"It has nothing with GoT except names of families. It is boring. Bad actings and boring plot. Yawn.I wonder if any Dr Who lovers can't bring themselves to hate Daemon since they would remember Matt Smith as Dr. Who.They introduce a character and even without backstory they kill them. Why you bother to introduce without deepness in the first place?Throwing some incest, same sex relationship into mix is GoT thing but here it just a lazy writing and shooting.They think they can getaway with association and reminisince.For example: Ser Criston Cole is pathetic reminder of Gregor Clegane.Well even writing a review about this shows is waste of time. (like watching it)HBO please cancel it already."
"HBO should fire everyone involved in this production except for the drones pilot and the hairdressers. The storyline...you know when you re-write an email so many times you don't even know what it means anymore? Anyone who approved it must have been temporarily occupying the wrong office. The cast: forget it, there are no possible explanations, maybe two-three out of all actors physical appearance support their characters, unfortunately neither of them can act. What else? Nothing much, I don't think there was a director involved. Some nice SGI buy certainly not enough to save a haphazard collection of scenes from being irrelevant."
"This is a show which is only riding on sucess of the popular series ""Game of Thrones"". It is so sad that George R R Martin only provided the outline of the house of dragon in his book ""Fire & Blood"" so I know that the overall story is going to good but a show doesn't work only if it's story outline is good. All the small events and character profiling should also be good and at which the writers of the show are failing very badly. They have managed to make every character looks like a hypocrite with small events in the show making no sense. It seems like the people involved in production of this show only picked the elements which ""they thought"" were ""highlights"" of the GoT like riding a dragon, ships sailing in vast sea and just dumped them in HoD to recreate the grandeur of the series."
"First I have stopped to watch the show after the EP3. After a few days continued, bu I have should not!The plot is so simole, boring and slow. There is a lot of talking mainly about the who want to be the king, but nothing really happens....."
"I have decidet to watch this show becouse of the good rating. But I realised now that the rating is whortless,"
Clearly become the part of the filmmaking budget to generate good rewiwews...
"Now I think this type of businesmodell for the ilmmakers won't be sustainable, becouse I will not belive it. Next time I will stop watching when I realise it is a crap..."
This should not have been made. At least not so soon. Every episode seems disjointed and gets worse each week. Why does it have such great reviews? We're they paid reviewers? Who knows. They thought gratuitous dragon scenes and such would make up for lack of substance but I beg to differ. Why switch actors mid season? It was so odd to see Raynera played by a different person. 10 years isn't enough to require a different person. None of the characters are particularly interesting. Dialogue is bland. Doesn't flow. I rather watch the bad lipsynch version of this show.Forget the next season. Ciao.
"It had every potential to be entertaining and I gave it the benefit of the doubt, but seven episodes in and I am over it. How many times must it be time for Daemon to 'come home'? And where are the dudes eyebrows? Every time there's a close up it's all I can think about. Maybe I missed the back story? Maybe that's the plot I should follow to be more interested in the show? Other than that the characters are shallow, uninteresting and just plain boring. However when you have GOT to compare to, not much can do better. Very disappointing. How this has such a high rated IMDB score is beyond me. RIP GOT."
"Talk about a slow burn... this version drags indefinitely with a few exciting scenes along the way. Majority of it is just family drama, which doesn't work because the character development is so bland that you don't really connect with anybody enough to want to root for them. A dragon could've killed the whole cast off and I wouldn't care.Don't get me wrong, this still has a lot of promise and I'm really hoping the next season (if there is one) will finally pick up the storyline and end this never ending slow burn because the potential is clearly there. As of right now though, season one was a boring soap opera to me and a bit of a disappointment."
"Say what you want about GOT's season 8 ending, but House of the Dragon's lack of engagement and excitement truly underscores the monumental role David and Dan played in shaping the world of Game of Thrones. They are truly missed. House of the Dragon often left me nodding off; it lacks consistency and character development. I feel no connection what so ever to the lead characters and have no interest in what comes next.One can't help but wonder if it was GRRM's responsibility all along. To this day, he has yet to conclude his original novel. Avoiding backlash perhaps? I have no doubt he also signed off on that Season 8 ending. He bears just as much, if not more, responsibility. Frankly, I can't blame David and Dan for growing tired of steering a ship without original material, waiting for the author to finish something he began almost 30 years ago. They probably hoped he'd be done by the time they reached season 8, but he wasn't. Yet, they were the ones scapegoated while GRRM remained silent in a distance.Rating this a 4 instead of 1 is solely due to the potential of the original material, which could have been adapted more effectively for the big screen by a better showrunner."
"Loved GoT, amazing story execution. Look forward to each episode, felt like a grand adventure. On the other had the HotD plot is very weak, few characters, main ""villain"" not very compelling or frightening. For each episode we keep hoping that it gets better, but disappointed each time. Don't understand the 8.7 IMDB rating, it definitely doesn't deserve it. The only thing going for this show it is linked to GoT, and the only highlight is that it has is dragons. But this is not sufficient to base a complete series on, it should be a single episode. There is also no character development for the dragons, so we end up not even caring about them. Overall, very disappointed for the GoT."
It started with a lot of promises but short after that the show starts turning in circles.There where not even one character I care about more and more the only reason I continue watched was the question when the king dies.I mean why he did not marry his own daughter in the first place and avoid so much trouble I know it is disgusting but in this show everyone could marry anyone to fulfil his duty and keep the baby factory running.The final deathblow was E6 ..what in gods name the show runner thought about that ?Replacing the main leads in the mid of a show ....a young woman replaced a young woman ...one of the stupidest decisions in movie history.
"Compared to Rings of power, this one falls short in many areas. It's too fast paced - it fails to engage the audience with random transitions and underwhelming side stories.The parent series GOT has a stronger footing and characters that were absolutely engaging.For a show that's called ""The House of Dragon"", there's not a lot of scenes with the dragons. Instead it seems like a maternity ward where queens (young and old) keep popping kids.The storyline seems unnecessarily complicated. Visuals are mediocre and the music is a repetition of game of thrones. George Martin seems to have been in a haste to get this story out. Sad."
"Review after 6 episodes.House of Dragon covers ""Dance of Dragons"" events from GRRM book ""Fire and Blood"".They could have started from the beginning from Aegon the Conqueror but I guess CGI for dragons would be too expensive? Are planing to do multiple prequel and make more money?Casting is off and very very bad. Actors portraying the main characters do not have the charisma. Actors are just not likeable compared to original GoT casts.Casting director: What are you doing? You could have made actors look older? With makeup? You keep some actors but replace some?House Targaryen - Blonde/ white hair/ wig look so fake on all Targaryens. Matt Smith is bad and not convincing as dashing and dangerous prince Daemon. Some reviewers think that Matt Smith is good choice but I have to disagree. He is a good actor by total miscast as Daemon.I prefer younger princess Rhaenyra better casting then older princess Rhaenyra.House Velaryon - awful and woke casting, the white hair look so fake. It took me a few moment to relize who was who after timeline skip.After time skip? How come that men look the same? It seems that they did not even age and you kept same actor?Costume looks cheaper and nothing compared to GoT.CGI is bad. Looks very fake sometimes.I do not understand current 8.6 score."
"Having watched three episodes, I can say with confidence that this show is a snooze! Even the ""action"" scenes (which are few and far between!) are dull. Mostly, boring characters sit around and talk about their uninteresting problems. The actors are fine, the production is lavish-but the show is just inert. Will the show get better after these first three episodes? Don't know and don't care! This show is not compelling, engaging, or even entertaining! I was a ""Game of Thrones"" fan (well, until that awful final season!), but ""House of Dragons"" really isn't in the same league as GoT. Disappointed!"
"Very uninvolving,took me 2 hours to finish the episode. Not a single character is likable or interesting in any way except for maybe the queen but they killed her during the episode in the most horrifing fashion imaginable. Without Game of Thrones scope and variaty of locations and vivid characters and most impotrantly without it's sense of mistery all that is left is back-stabbing and power play which becomes drag-on really fast.20 minutes in and the first head roll off. And we are talking about period of peace in Westeros. Then somebody had his testackes removed with a knife-or was that penis? Can't be sure because my eyes were closed. They double down the gore probably because some HBO boss decided so but it all felt very unearned and unecessary,just shock for the sake of it.Pesonally I felt tired by the sheer negativity of it all. It's too depressing,too ugly,too miserable.One more episode and if everything stays just the same I'm off."
"As the last season of GoT caved in on itself by hasting and leaving plot holes totally un-developed. This new serie does it even worse, with already a very poor story they have the nerve to skip a decade what is unheard-of for a series like this it supposed to be an epic drama/action not a soap serie. Missing a decade of plot it makes the serie un watchable and fall to be described as mediocre at best. Episode six for me is the final episode for me will not return to the franchise. Not only is the story bad but the young cast is even worse, do they have a clue what they are doing? I savor the memory of the original!"
"This is straight into the political and warmongering side of Game of Thrones but has totally lost the genius of the (first 4 seasons) original, humour. The gossiping, the snide comments, the humour, the wickedness and the game playing. This has been replaced by laboured pacing, straightforward scripting and absolutely zero layering.They have picked really good actors but they are being let down by a basic script and think they will be saved by Dragons. The only character that has anything about them is Deamon, and his story line is just as predictable as everyone else's.Also, could have had a different theme tune.Give me some laughter, give me some back stabbing and give me some whispers in the corridors."
"I thought the white hair just looked daft on the characters unlike in GOT. There are no beauties or handsome men like there are in GOT, except for the wife of the king who obviously doesn't have a long contract. There is a reason why actors become popular and it is usually about their look's whether they play a good guy or a bad guy. The scene with violence felt like it was just slotted in to give the impression it was like GOT and being as we didn't get to know the people being butchered beforehand, it fell flat. GOT kings and queens all had a presence with booming voices and it felt like they had power in their own mind, the king and prince in HOTD were lacking that. Whereas I couldn't wait to watch GOT every week I'm not sure I will be so excited to watch this, it just felt like a weaker repeat without the aesthetics, nor the emotion for the viewer that is accompanied. I don't feel I care about what will happen to any of the characters and hopefully they wiont stretch out the irritating prince character for too many episodes which will become annoying and make me want to switch off from watching it. But so far without him they don't really have much of a storyline, albeit one we have seen before in GOT. Too much hype has gone into this series so I was expecting something special and am disappointed with the same stuff."
"Predictable at best. They could had used so many different stories from the past of GOT but they chose this because of the hype around the character of Dani and they thought this would invoke nostalgic memories and help them push the project forward. The truth is that you cant work on a budget when you want your movie to match the level of GOT, because it was something extraordinary. The CGI looks HORRIBLE some times and the actors NOT invested in the role. The casting is way off and the characters lack any charisma. Everything is boring, cheap and predictable."
"So it took the violence, gore, nudity, sex... but this is no longer enough. It lacked haracters. The CGI was awful on the dragons. Really poor opener."
"I apologize to all the hard working employees of this show - 5 episodes in, I am doing chores around the house since the show allows it.Not a single scene made me watch this show with some interest, I am truly not lying when I say that NOTHING happens, the characters are dull, the actors are completely miscasted.I am starting to think that GoT set the bar so high, that none of the shows that follow will ever be near it.Then why bother at all creating it?The 10&9 reviews really make me cringe, people expect so little from Tv shows nowadays. As long as you have some medieval costumes and a couple of dragons, one would rate anything high, right?I did watch it for the sake of GoT but it is nowhere near it."
"House is the dragon?I quit this series after episode 5 or 6. The first episode was okay but you can tell they were trying hard and even throwing a bath tub at the situation.We all know Game Of Thrones ended like trash. I know it, you know it and they knew it so they pumped up episode one hoping to hook us. Chances are this show isn't going to get better. Why waste your time watching something like this who literally took the whole thing over just to make sure they made money on the back, back end of the deal. I say let them eat cake. Dragon cake. CGI and all! Now fly off and watch something else."
"I gave this four stars primarily for special effects, and good dragons.For the rest, my primary takeaway after 6 episodes is that there is not one likeable character in the series.They range from vaguely unpleasant or incompetent or stupid, through annoying, all the way to totally psychotic.Perhaps I am in the minority here, but I actually like shows I am watching to have one or two characters that I enjoy watching. Doesn't matter whether it is the protagonist or the bad guy, just give me a character or two to derive pleasure out of.Oh and by the way the sound engineer is not very good. Neither the tonal balance nor the voice amplitude during dialog are consistent.So why am I watching this show at all? If it were to depend on me, I wouldn't. My partner wants to watch it, so I go along in total bemusement as to why anyone would do this to themselves voluntarily."
"GOT had loads of dark humor on top of great dialog, plots, acting, directing, etc. Sadly this series is missing all of that. Remember the adrenaline rushes in GOT, especially when the dragons made their grand entrances? Remember the suspense? Remember the great actors? Sadly this series is missing all of that also. What can I say that is positive? I'm still viewing it in hopes of finding it. One article I read indicated that the dragons would have distinctive personalities. Perhaps they do only in comparison with the human actors. HBO currently lacks so much content right now maybe due to Covid. Here's hoping that changes soon."
This shows being treated like it's 5 perfect seasons of breaking bad or four perfect seasons of GOT. This show has promise but lacks the heart that GOT displayed. Part of that is the constant time jumps that are skipping over any possible character development that might have been possible for viewers to enjoy. The wigs are godawful and so far through one season it is a soap opera with dragons every few episodes. The dialogue is clunky at times and over all lacks the wittiness from GOT.There's just not enough screen time and depth into the characters so far for you to feel the attachedness you felt by the middle of season 1 of GOT. And to be honest they didn't deserve Paddy or Matt SmithStill it is worth the watch and you can feel maybe just maybe they are on the cusp of something worthy of the GOT ties coming eventually but the wigs need major updates for season 2 and the dialogue and pacing needs a major overhaul. Honestly looking forward to the SNOW show I trust Kit Harrington more than any show runner involved with this.
"If you're reading the reviews of the people who are calling it promising, these are those people who defended the finale of GOT.So watch and you decide on your own.On my side, i find it non interesting, specially characters, they're all so dumb, like they're faking everything, no soul in acting, utter garbage choice.Knights look stupid, lol.The king look like a waiter ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚, i mean he should atleast wear clothes like a kingCmon man, you should've given a better show, rather than this trash.I pity those who defend such show. Just because of people like you, we're loosing good stories, cause you can watch anything."
"I waited for the second episode before writing this because I wanted to give the show another chance. I don't really want to dump on HBO. I know they are hoping to revive the magnificent spectacle that was Game Of Thrones; the international, multi-generational audience, the global watch parties etc.... I wish them the best and hope this show pays off. But I don't think I'll be carrying on. Not because it's bad. I don't really think it's ""bad"". It's just, as I had feared, a lackluster knock-off. It's what the Hobbit films were to the Lord Of The Rings; an obvious attempt to cash in on a better product by trying (and failing) to do more of the same. I find it a little ironic that people who trashed the last season of GoT could love HotD. I too was disappointed in the last season of GoT, but not for the reasons I heard from many other fans. And this series already has all the elements I disliked about the final season. The things that hooked me on GoT were the pacing of the scenes, the realism in location and nuance, the way they introduced and developed characters, the natural banter etc... all of those were abandoned in the final season of GoT, and none of these things are evident from the beginning in this show. The Double D's were offered plenty of money to deliver the full ten episodes for the final season. But for some reason they opted to give us a truncated season, abandoning their long established scene and character development, opting instead for quick expositional scenes and battles filled with hackneyed deus-ex-machina moments. But it took the Double D's years to take so many short cuts. From the start of HotD, the pacing is quick. Scenes are not given time to breath and therefor characters have no time to develop beyond their specific role in the story. Remember when we first met Ned Stark and his family... and Robert Barathoen? Remember when we were first introduced to Danyeras and Littlefinger, and Cercai and Jamie and TYRION! We met all those characters in the very first episode. And how quickly, for good and bad, they won us over. But I have not yet seen one character in HotD whose story I really care to follow. And the dialogue isn't much more than huge info-dumps delivered by GoT style caricatures. Everything has a glossy CG sheen, the modern equivalent of putting Vaseline on the lens. And nothing has any weight. The jousting scene tried to replicate the realism of The Mountain's battle with gore.... tried and failed, imo. GoT felt real. Authentic. This just felt gratuitous. But the real test for me is simple: do I want to watch more? And the sad answer is, not really. I'm not a hater. I don't think it's bad. It's just meh... and it's competing for my attention with a lot of other new shows... and sadly not cutting it. I really wanted to like it. I did.(EDIT: I realized I was wrong about meeting all the afore mentioned GoT characters in the first epiosde. I think we don't meet Little Finger until episode 2... or 3 maybe? It's been a while. But the rest still stands.)"
"Got tricked again. The cashing in on the best tv series in history continues. First Wheel of Time now this. What made GoT great was the top notch production values, the excellent political intrigue and the experienced cast, comprised of seasoned A list English actors and talented fresh players. If you are familiar with British movies and television many of the faces in GoT were instantly recognizable. Both prequels feature a few famous names with large supporting casts of mostly new and inexperienced actors. Season 8 of GoT was better than either of the imitators. Many feel it is unfair to compare but if the main concept is used as the springboard (including the same theme music) it is hard not to. If one has not seen the original one might think this is good."
"This prequel is simply an effort to make more money off the Game of Thrones 9.2 series with a lower budget. It promotes the woke indoctrination of the less educated in our society. One point made by Ned Stark in Game of Throne was the importance of pure ancestry. This series takes that idea and twist it into a very dirty lineage. It takes the believable fantasy which is what made GOT so loved by its viewers and totally ignores it. It seems very rushed, leaving great stories untold. This film like many others made now days wants to remove any trace of separate but equal, which was the history of our world and wipe it out. I believe that if this film was made before GOT it would be given a 5.0 or less by most viewers simply due to its inability to form great relationships between the characters seen in GOT.I was left very disappointed."
"I've really waited for this. There are so many stories that could be told, from the time before GOT as prequals or sequals.I prepped myself by spending the last week watching all of GOT, to get into the Westeros again.But unfortunately the first episode was a let down.There where a lot of nudity, sex and violence in GOT. And there where people that where gay, lesbian, eunuchs, and incest drove a major storyline. It was edgy and something no one else dared to produce.But in GOT those scenes always seemed to be there to drive the story, or tell us something about a character.Not so in the first episode of the house of dragon.After the first episode I'm not in the least invested in any of the characters, there are no one I'm waiting in anticipation to learn more of.I'm not sure if this is a worthy successor to GOT, but I have a sneaking suspicion that what we will get are a boring drama, with some GOTish scenes put in so they can believe they have satisfied GOT fans."
"I didn't expect this to come close to the original series, and it doesn't even have to, but this has no resemblance at all. It's a one dimensional, flat story with mediocre characters. The fact that there are huge time jumps between the episodes worsens the problem since it makes it just irritating and even harder to follow.It all seems very pointless, there are no plot twists, no thrilling moments, nothing to look forward to, not even characters that you can care about.Honestly this series wouldnt even hit the 5.0 mark if it wasn't for the GoT label and because people find dragons cool. Those are really badly animated by the way."
"Fantasy soap opera with no interesting characters and terrible casting choice. Wearing white hairs, costumes and swords, flying the dragons is not enough, so far this story goes in predictable direction which means... a cliche.The Game of Thrones was about characters really interesting and original, each single one. Here we got an opposite."
"After watching season one, I can only say this, it seems that the general directors, producers, and writers of this show don't know how to turn books into TV shows. With the two D&D brothers, until the end of season 6, at least they did an excellent job. When I watched 6 seasons of GOT, I didn't even think it was episodes made from the pages of George, a cunning Cersei, a cruel, stupid Joffrey, a sly Arya, a heartbroken Sansa, those characters're successfully built with their story on screen, not in the pages of a book.And with HotD, if they are going to build characters like this, will no one see all the good and unique of the characters, or do they have to watch the show while holding the book? At the same time? I even wish the writers were bolder, they could even create more characters to support the important characters to develop their personalities.The story of the Targaryen family is told very intermittently, interrupted by invisible periods, the characters being replaced midway. Let's see what happens to Daario Naharis in GOT, nobody notices him anymore. And in particular, many episodes have absurd, confusing, and boring scenes. Take Daemon's battle at the Narrow Sea, for example.What's encouraging about the show is that the staging, the set design, the costumes, the hair, the makeup, the visual effects, the music, it's all great, beautiful and expensive, which I want them to maintain until the end of the show.If you want to see an average show and dragons, maybe this is the show for you, and if your standards are at GOT, you'll probably want to scream at the scriptwriters and say: Try harder!"
"I dont know who wrote the screenplay but I am totally disappointed. If I need a manual to understand it although I am a huge fan of Game of Thrones, it is a bad written screenplay. I think the show only lives because of the fans of Game of Thrones who celebrate everything, no matter how bad it is, only because it is part of the world of Game of Thrones. So many things dont make sense: 1. Why they use other actors for Alicent and Rhaenyra? Daemon and other charakters looks the same and not older and Viserys got an old mask and Aemon looks much older than Aegon! 2. What about Criston Cole? He wanted to marry Rhaenyra and the next moment he hates her only because she has to be loyal to the Throne and duty? Such big hate only because of a broken heart of an ex-lover over so many years? He spoke about honour but did so many cruel things? Why did he kill the lover of Leanor Velaryon in front of all people having no consequences? In episode 9 he also killed a member of the council and nothing happens? Who is he? The King? No! He proclaims Aegon as the new king and gives him the crown in episode 9??? He has nothing to say! This is not his job?? And he is totally loyal to Alicent only because she prevented his suicide? Come on! The development of the characters is missing! Every twist in the story seems to be boring because you think ""oh ok, why?"". 3. Rhaenyra offered Alicent a peaceful solution and she didnt accept it? Why? Only because the story has to go on!!! She doesnt want to ignore Rhaenyras claim to the Throne and want to protect her children and in the next scene she hates her and her easy lifestyle so much and the next scene she doesnt want to risk a war having Aegon on the Throne and want to help her - it all doesnt make sense! 4. Who is Otto Hightower to take over the job of the King? Game of Thrones showed us in season 1 that Robert Baratheon had to write down a permisson that Lord Stark, the hand of the king, will rule until his ""son"" is old enough and Cersei riped it as the Queen but here it is no problem! Also the King's Guard is loyal to Daemon and now they fulfil the orders of Otto Hightower, Daemon totally hates??? And the explanation ""the King said he wants Aegon on the Throne"" from Alicent is enough for the Council, the King's Guard, the Nation and the Lords and Ladys who swear their loyalty to Rhaenyra?? And all the servants and princess Rhaenys are caught because they shouldnt talk about the death of the King or to Rhaenyra but the King's Guard is no problem? Being loyal to prince Daemon? 5. How Rhaenys got her armor? And why she did not burn all of them? I mean, Rhaenyra and Daemon would have pardon her? No, she will go to Rhaenyra and risk a war with Vhagar ... thats so stupid. She did it only for the story - the story has to go on ... 6. Why does the King's Guard close the doors in the end of episode 9? Did they want to commit suicide with a dragon in the room? 7. The white wurm put its life in danger only to get the word from Otto Hightower???? She definitely needed a pressure medium! So all in all - maybe there are good answers from some fans or the screenwriters towards my questions or critics but let me say that again: if I need a manual to understand the show, it is a bad show! You have to see the show with the eyes of the consumer! It is totally unlogical for me! I will not watch the show or an episode again. I will also not watch episode 10! Me and my boyfriend were totally annoyed during episode 9 and we wanted to turn out the TV because it was enough unlogical stuff! It is too bad for the actors and especially Matt Smith!"
"I tried after being repulsed by the first episode to give it a chance with the second. Had to shut it off. As others have mentioned in their reviews the casting, hair and makeup and production in general is not good, but the worst casting was of the princess who acts 12 who is supposed to be 15 and is always looking pouty. It appears they are giving her a bigger role which the girl cannot handle. Too many bad choices for this production. Hair and makeup is really bad. Bad wigs and nothing that looks real. The CG is lacking as well. Was it money that made this such a poor production or was it the producers' choices. Not sure about the story. Seemed lean. Very disappointing because of the choices that they have made. It appears they try to repulse the audience at any opportunity with the shots they make. Too bad.GOT is dead."
"Let me just start by saying this.While writing this, the IMDB rating for this show, over 50% has given it a 10/10. 10 of 10 means, in theory, that 50% actually believe this is the best show in the history of shows.Anyone else who think this smells of trolling? Or rating-manipulation? No? Just me?Compared to GoT, it is slow and unoriginal, with few main characters to cheer for. In GoT you had the entire world of Westeros with all its kingdoms and all its protagonists and antagonists. You had John Snow, Arya Stark, Goeffrey, the dragon-lady and so on. Now you just have these two teenage girls, a dad and an uncle.The dragons aren't really that exciting either. In GoT you followed them from birth until they were fully grown. You knew them, you cheered for them, you cried for them. Now they are just there, and their not really that cool.The cast is boring, the protagonist is just this small teenage girls, and thats it.I give it 5/10 because I feel bad for the actors. It's not their fault, poor things."
I save you some time. You don't need to read long reviews about how bad casting and acting are. Or long sentences about the non existing plot. After ep5. I summerise this show with just one word:PATHETIC!It seems like reviews cannot be short now as imdb requires me to write min 600 character thus taking the chance away from me to humiliate this creation with a short review. Anyway. Those of you who agrees with me knows that the real review ends at the world in capitals. And any more charaters put in for this shows is as wasted as any dollar cents spent on it. I am laughing now that i still have to type in order to reach minimum lenght. Is this how this over hyped show being protected from negative comments...?
"Poorly lit, filming looked muddy, the principle characters unconvincing, Mat Smith looked the part until he spoke, no gravitas or strength of character in his voice, came across as a bit Whiny"
"No the jury's out. GOT grabbed you from the first episode and didn't let go with terrific casting, let's see if there is an improvement."
"Just got thru half of the fifth episode and omg this is the end for me...how does anyone think this is good?! The script is all over the shop and the casting is just ludicrous and it's just plain boring. GOT this is not, but I guess even the original author saw this coming and just gave up...I frankly don't blame him, his story was fantastic, this is utter nonsense, shameful, sad. I guess they had to try to milk it for all it was worth but this is literal ""shark jumping""...to be honest I'd rather watch Fonzie waterski over a shark than this sorry adaptation of woke baloney. One star for the cgi dragons."
"I didn't expect this to be as good as GOT, but, JFC, at least half, if not, more as good. This.... this is just a mere pale version of GOT (no pun intended). Have the director/s deliberately asked the actors to play down their characters or are they on prozac. The acting is very flat and boring, none are threatening nor witty, in fact the whole thing is boring. I was doing something else while it was on, this show does not hold my attention, this would never have happened with GOT, ever. There's no mystery here and please don't say it's only the first season, that's crap. GOT was fantastic from the first episode with superb and brilliant writing, I was enthralled by it. This show is very bland and generic, sadly, I highly doubt I will continue to watch this snooze fest, I had such bloody high hopes, what an effing disappointment."
"Whatever happened to the deep political intrigue we are used to from GOT?? What is this drama and political correctness that they dragged into this supposedly imaginary world??I came to watch the story of a house that tamed dragons and maintained political control over the kingdoms.. I found a story of clichÃ© love and desperate romantics fighting over pity things!Completely disappointed and lost interest in watching anymore of this slow boring show!P.s. The plot is very predictable and you can tell what is going to happen at the end of almost every scene. Furthermore, The writing is very cringe sometimes and they just couldn't help bringing political correctness and gender equality into the equation. HBO it is meant to be a fictional story!V."
"The show is beautifully filmed and the CGI is excellent. The story, characters, and plot are full of rushed holes and inconsistencies. The constant time jumps makes the plot difficult to become invested in and even follow. The actors selected don't match their ages for example the Queen Alicient looks to be younger than her adult sons (I believe they are the same age in real life). The characters also don't match their younger selves well save a few. The plot and great acting is what made GoT famous, this show just doesn't have that unfortunately. I used to await new GoT episodes with intense anticipation, but HoD I don't really have any investment or interest I am not even sure I'll bother watching the last few espisodes as the first were such a letdown.Biggest flaws: Casting, Time Jumps, Acting, Plot (Maybe the plot is good it was just directed wrong?)"
"Biggest Pluses: CGI, Cinemagtography, Language/LoreThis could have been done so much better."
"This show is vastly overrated. I'm not sure if it's the constant time jumps or what, but all the characters feel underdeveloped and even after completion of the first season, the development of the characters seem like they've been developed over one episode rather than ten. Are people seriously enjoying this show? There seems to be this weird phenomenon where people want to like this show and I'm just not buying that viewers actually are, at least not as much as they're pretending they are.Wanting to like a show could maybe work for one season, but it's going to get old come the second season. The CrabFeeder is the perfect metaphor for this show. Just some underdeveloped schmo who twitches and looks like an a**hole."
"This dreadfully color graded, horrifically written (not even pleasant as an irony), shockingly edited, boring and quite honestly infuriating pile of dung, almost assuredly, even in consideration of the fact that there are no certainties, has, just has to be an evil joke of sorts... Even the dragons. They even messed that up... The first 20 minutes of this show brought on waves of malaise. My expectations were low, but in consideration of the first 6 seasons of GoT, I decided to ruin the rest of my night, and likely a few thereafter. I question the legality of this atrocity.Despite my sufferings a small part of me cherishes the idea of my involvement in this predicament, as we collectively, probably at once, have been royallyBAM-BOOZLEDpg-13 bridgerton with dragons."
"First of all the cast are terrible and the characters even worse. Non of them are likeable, in fact they are irritating. The story is boring. Who will be the heir? A loose cannon with ambition and sinister intentions. Sound familiar?Production values and cinematography are on point. I turned it off about 5 minutes before the end because I had enough. Disappointing unfortunately."
"I came to HOTD in hopes the new series would redeem the damage done to the prior series. Lost is the political intrigue of the previous GOT. There was a hint of this initially but now it appears as though the story is far more one dimensional. Milly Alcock and Matt Smith were the stand outs, but now Alcock is out and replaced by a frumpy Emma D'arcy.Storyline has quickly become convoluted. The choice to rapidly swap out actors much older than the prior ones has further changed the dynamic. Milly young and full of life. Emma sour and stoic. Would've preferred a gradual aging and a continuity in personality.Warning to show writers: Expediency in the end killed ALL respect D&D had built in the original GOT. Let the story unfold. Less dragon. More dialogue and story that the franchise was known for. It is still early and I have not given up but this storytelling is nowhere near as intriguing as early GOT. If the show runners don't bring their A-game they will quickly lose this viewer."
"They spent all this time and money for (somehow) worse special effects, terrible dialogue, woke 2022 political themes, and appallingly bad acting. My mates and I have video games with better graphics. What a waste of a brilliant actor like Paddy Considine, who will just now be discovered by the American audiences, and will now be forever connected to this complete failure. The entire plot is predictable and the only mysteries left to the viewer is which HBO execs get fired by Warner Brothers when the season ends."
"I, for one, had no problem with the ending of GOT - just the way they steered into it. It was like they dumped Kubrick for Michael Bay to wrap things up and kept him for the prequel.That ending was the prelude to HOD: Inept lazy writing. Absurd logic. Insultingly pandering.Where GOT had near Shakespearian complex intrigue and dialogue, HOD is more 3d rate soap opera, telegraphing nearly every badly drawn moment.One example: For some reason Ser Cristen bashes the brains out of a royal's paramour - not even of his own Court! - in front of everyone - and in the next scene he's in the garden alone calmly contemplating self-disembowelment (opportunity lost) ...sure.We're suddenly 10 years ahead, - Ser Cristen (he's no Jon Snow), Daemeon (Neil Patrick Harris' 'evil twin'? Stay tuned...),. Viserys (still dying), and 80% of the cast haven't aged a day, but 3 main characters are now middle aged - with kids.There were 'literally' a dozen ways to make that jump more convincing - but why start now. At least the costumes are nice.Let's address the telegraphing.Daxos, the Pirate, and the Dothrakians were some of the the best drawn characters of GOT - integral and organic to the story. If you buy into the HOD world-scape, we're either looking at a future 'Black Wedding' or a mass exodus to shoehorn into a fascist, white privileged post-dragon GOT - sorry for the spoiler.I'm out."
"The problem is that when a tv show proves so popular as this people want it to continue, unfortunately the ingredients that made G. O. T so popular are so far not here.This used to be unmissable tv with twists and shocks that you never knew who was safe or how things would turn out. Now I find myself almost bored watching this.The last season of game of thrones lacked depth and just tried to follow a pattern and could have been written by anyone but like this is lacking. I challenge anyone to rewatch the first season and compare it to this.I like better call Saul but again is no breaking bad, these shows are legendary and can't be repeated"
It's a bit like the movise when you have so many sequels.
"Poor, very poor casting. Especially the actress playing Princess Rhaenyra.And also Matt Smith as Prince Daemon Targaryen. These characters need a completely different acting presence, charm and charisma."
"South Park nailed it with 'member berries.People love reliving something brilliant.You won't find it in HOTD.The magic, intrigue, and tension are all absent."
GoT is the most beautiful show I've ever wanted except 7th and 6th seasons and this new related thing that called house of dragon is not even close Got had those beautiful and talented actors and actresses.
"Watched with eager anticipation but wasn't impressed. A boring political soap opera with a smattering of horrifying violence and stupidity. Nothing to see here, please disperse."
"I know that my review will get a lot of disagreements but I'm going to say this anyway.What the hell is this? In my opinion, this is just the house of boredom and it's so dull, as some people said. I only decided to watch this show because Matt Smith was in it. I could only watched 15 minutes of the first episode and then got bored. The plot is so ridiculous. Plus, it's all about politics which, I think, made me bored. Politics are the last thing I'm going to be interested in. And I feel like this show is something men would like. And I'm a woman, so, I think this is why I don't like this show.Anyway, this show may have a lot of fans and a lot people might be crazy about this show, but as for me, it is indeed one of the worst TV series I've watched this year.One star only. (I wished I could give no star, but I gave one star for my favourite actor, Matt Smith.)"
"The budget for production and the established GoT and Song of Ice Fire worlds make it kind of ok sometimes. The show itself...It just isn't good. Looks cool and every so often it will relate to GoT and that's fun I guess; but lots seem forced and lazy.If this exact show came out on ABC or FOX before GoT dropped and didnt have quite this level of production value It would have a 6 on here and no second season.Many of the actors and actresses are amazing. I would have given it a 7, weeks ago mostly due to performances. Those seem to be fading as well and I'm not a fan of the newest actress portrayal of her character. I wont say who at risk of spoilersThe dragons are super cool though. I give it a 4 but just the dragons make it at least worth a shot in case it gets better."
"After squinting my way through three and a quarter episodes I just can not tell if this story is any good or not because half of the story is being told on a totally dark screen! I do not think my one year old Samsung Ultra High Definition television is to blame because I do not have this problem with other shows. I even turned out all the lights in the room and all adjacent rooms last night and still only got nothing but dim shadows.No, I am not wasting my time trying to guess what is going on, I will just call it a black cat in a coal bin at midnight and leave it at that.Sorry for the dark review (pun intended)."
"The casting didn't stay true to the original story and the acting was poor. It's sad that these days creators can't take the original story and create a show that does it justice, with characters that actually mirror what is clearly depicted within the story. The acting was good for a few of the characters such as the princess Rhaenyra, Alicent Hightower. And Daemon Targaryen. Corlys Velaryon wasn't even remotely close to what the original character was in the story, and this is one of a few casting decisions that didn't stay true to the original story. The action scenes were good and kept true to the brutality of what the story depicted in the books."
"Bad casting and boring story line, the little bit of plot it has is badly written. They try to cover the lack of storyline with exagerated violent scenes. Like the first jousting match, done way over the top with blood and gore for a sporting event. What makes it worse is the lack of likable characters like the Starks and Tyrion Lannister. Or characters you love to hate like Cersei Lannister. They are all pretty much two dimensional. I wish they spen more of thier special effects budget on hiring better writers. I though after watching the first episode it just starting slow, but after a few episodes of fighting to stay awake. It is just a attempt to cash in on GOT."
"After Game of Thrones (even with the problems of Season 8), watching House of the Dragons is like watching a low budget High School production of a Game of Thrones knockoff.The actors aren't believable and their motivations are never clear, the story is convoluted and pointless, and the time jumps pull you out of any narrative momentum they might have garnered.In the end, this series does nothing to enhance the world building established in Game of Thrones. If the characters (and actors) clearly don't seem to care, why should the audience?Finally, the high scores associated with these reviews are laughable at best. Don't waste your time."
"Despite commendable filmmaking efforts, this series flounders due to its abysmal script.The camera effects and sets are top-notch, the music is great, the costumes are mind-blowing, and the acting is great. But nothing can save the bad script with endless boring dialogues, long filler scenes with constant gore, and permanent references to incest or even sex with minors. You can basically fast forward through the entire season, and hearing 1-2 sentences per scene will give you the whole story.I certainly don't need another season of 8hours of political debate filled with overly graphic scenes desperately trying to shock the viewer."
"Remember the final season of Game of Thrones? If you thought that was awesome, you'll like House of the Dragon.I had mixed expectations going into House of the Dragon. The trailers had potential. George R R Martin was onboard. And, the Targaryen family was maybe the most interesting of the major Game of Thrones families. But, I really hated the storytelling in later seasons of Game of Thrones and HBO seemed intent on continuing in that vein.Well... HBO didn't disappoint. They went to the dark side, dropped the mike, and gave me the middle finger in every episode.The writing is abysmal. People don't behave the way characters should behave in House of the Dragon. Instead of acting the way their characters are written, their behavior seems dictated by whatever the episode needs. My disbelief wasn't suspended, so much as assaulted like Tysha, Tyrian's first wife, in Game of Thrones. The actors try and do their best, but with nonsensical dialogue, there is only so much an actor can do. The production values are good. It's a solid show visually, ruined continually by the words spewing forth from badly written characters mouths.At the end of the day House of the Dragon is like the first bite of plastic fruit. My advise, unless you're looking for a poorly written soap opera, give House of the Dragon's Droppings a big miss."
"How on earth did people make it through six or seven episodes? I managed to struggle through the first two episodes, got through episode three only by fast-forwarding a couple times, and gave up after ten minutes of episode four. I'm hesitant to even write a review because the few episodes I watched were so boring that I barely remember what happened. I do remember lots of talk about an heir to the throne, some dodgy CGI dragons that appear too soon and too often, and some bits of violence that felt tacked on and even a bit gratuitous in a failed attempt to liven things up and provide a bit of grittiness. At one point my roommate said that the show felt low-budget and I knew what he meant. Despite the visuals, sets, and costumes the story seems to be limited to a small number of characters and is severely lacking in scope. I'm out."
"People rating this a 10 are either bots, paid, or fan boys desperately wanting this show to be something it isn't. A 10 would mean perfect writing. Perfect acting. Perfect cinematography. Perfect everything. This flawed, boring snooze-fest is anything but perfect. It's flat out boring. I feel as though I'm watching a soap opera set in the Middle Ages.Give us some action. Give us interesting characters. Give us a damn story that's worthy of following. 3 episodes in and it's a 6 at best. I'll give it a couple of more episodes before completely giving up on it. Not sure why they chose this particular story line from GoT to revolve an entire series around. Should've chosen something more interesting like the White Walkers and their origin story with the Children."
"Just like every other GoT's fan, I've been eagerly waiting for House of the Dragon.First episode: bit dull, but fair dinkum, we have to get to know everyone. So that being said, basically everyone is dull as dishwater.Second episode: Even duller!Third episode: Had some action/fighting but again, we were drowned in more dialogue that really wasn't going anywhere.THE most wonderful thing about GoT's was the humor. I loved the snarky, funny, clever interaction that almost all the characters had. There isn't so much as a smirk in this. Everyone is very serious and honestly the dialogue is boring. I know it's not GoT's but it's not getting anywhere near by a long shot. The conversations and topic is almost the same in each scene. It's almost as though we're treading water until we get to the good bits....but I worry that there won't be any good bits.I'm not giving up watching it yet, but I am disappointed with it so far.I desperately want this to be fabulous and truly hope it will get there but it needs to hurry up."
"The show is watchable...barely, but there are three ingredients that are missing from this show. One, a timeline with a meaningful purpose. This show skips 5,10 years per a few episodes. Why? So far I really don't get the waste of time, literally, not only for the show, but me. It has very little significands so far. Two, there have been no real relationships built. Not sure if it's just me but relationships make any story more interesting. Three, where is the adventure? Everything seems to have been filmed on one set. There is very little, if any side stories and the two locations in the story...,have no story."
Call me old fashioned but I like a show where I am attached to a character and root for him/her in the whole show even though they perish in the end. Without the attachment it only becomes a show which I see for the sake of it. Most of the characters changes every two episodes anyways. If GOt was going at a snails place this is going at the pace of a rabbit. To see insolent aegon in painful enough but to see it in three different ages was too much. The last episode where it seems like the war will start on a misunderstanding of name seems like a flimsy lame reason. I am half in mind of just reading the summary for the next episodes and not wasted my time.
"Like many of you, i feel obligated to watch this series out of respect of GOT. I knew it's gonna be hard, almost impossible, to surpass the original, but I never thought it's going to be this bad. I mean what the heck??? I mean nothing really happened or important to be made as a story. No good guys, no likeable character, everyone just a_holes with their own agenda. It's like Cosby show with dragons in it. This series tarnish my sweet memories with GOT, even though I don't like how it ends, it's still the best series of all time. But this garbage is such a humiliation and mockery to the original. I gave 3 only because the dragons looks good. I will give 4 if they all go Dracarys the set and all the character. It should not be made at all. SHAME..3X."
"Game of Thrones was one of the greatest shows of all time but House of the Dragon was a huge let down.Thus far with only the 1st episode released all I can say is, House of the Dragon seemed extremely shallow and contrived. All of the characters lack depth and personality. The acting seemed forced and unnatural but imho was probably more the fault of the director than the actors. In fact episode 1 was so bad I highly doubt the show can redeem itself in future episodes."
"To think i rated 9 stars after 2 episodes .I seen now 8 episodes , and i find this has become really bad and boring .Milly Alcock had a great screen presence and without her its pretty much like nothing is left .Kinda weird she had to go because time gap but then some others look still the same , also this jump in time happens , but still nothing happens,"
"so u wonder what is it all good for .But it was getting bad anyway .First 2 episodes , i found promising , but from then on each episode is just dissapointing .You expect something in episode 4 or 5 or 6 to happen , but never does.Pretty much lost all intrest by now .Watching episode 8 , i notice i wonder who again are some of these characters , but then notice i dont even care anymore .A lot of talking in very dark rooms , i dont see how this is great tv .I dont see how this can be rated much better then Rings series , even though i find that series has some big flaws as well .Watching last episodes felt like a waste of time , i never expected this series to become this bad and boring after the promising start ."
Should have gone with House Stark on this one. The Targaryens are just boring. The only interesting thing about them is the fact that some of them rode dragons. Other than that there is nothing to keep my interest. So many scenes of people staring across the way at each other and no one speaking as if that's supposed to be dramatic but actually it's almost laughable...poor writing poor direction. No intrigue. I've fast forwarded thru too many scenes. Just disappointing.... I need to fill up this space with more words in order to post but there's nothing left to say. Oohh i will fill it with a dramatic stare...
"To oblige artistic expression to insert certain directives is to restrain it. Never liked it.There was a moral time, now it's a woke time, it's LGBT time, it's anti-racism time.So, you have to have all of these things packed and impressed in what is considered present art, either in writing, cinema, you name it, it's imperative. That was a thing you shouldn't have to expect in a series of this kind, in HBO, in the expression of George Martin. Instead you have baroque wigs, pretentious false wigs, a prominence of African ethnicity, LGBT actors that want to be called by plural and a sensation of something being forced and artificiality.You have great costumes and scenarios but they should be represented as 200 years more archaic than Game of Thrones. Not to mention the dialogues and the characterization. Again, false wigs, bland acting, out-of-place sensation, plastic. There's no real tension, theater, drama, realism as in the first 5 seasons of Game of Thrones, there's this beautiful politically (woke) correct package perfectly hollow with pivots that are pretending to act... for a very specific audience.I had to stop viewing each episode at some point not because I was astonished but because I was bored, frustrated and disappointed! This is literally, a «travesti» of the first seasons of Game of Thrones."
"Maybe I have set expectations too high, but in comparisson with original series this is not even a 2. If you take GOT, and strip characters, plotline, details and add fast-forward option you get House of the Dragon.There is only single plotline stream (which we already saw in GOT), characters are shallow, every little detail is predictable, and nothing which makes you wonder what is going to happen next. There is king who has brother plotting against him, and already now we know he will kill him. His daughter, of course will be banished and will have to fight back to get back what belongs to her - Iron Throne.Decided to stop watching...Tag me if I'm wrong."
Nothing but forced sex and murder is that all HBO can do I mean come on what the hell are we watching here I'll tell you it's the same thing hbo does over and over again no story and all rape and murder. Honestly I just can't even take these show's seriously if that's all they are I know humans are not idiots they know they are watching tape and murder but I just don't get why they think it's ok and why it entertains them to see such gross stuff and way over done stuff. Humans who make this do better and humans that watch this come on stop being idiots your literally watching something that's been done so very many times.
A worthy sequel to the last season of Game of Thrones. :-/
"Nevertheless, there were still good actors in that one...No real characters, incredible basic roles (so the first main villain is called 'Daemon', c'mon...), sex as a prop (it has no role in the story, but a GT episode cannot be left without fornication), a mixture of brutal jousting and gladiatorial games, arbitrary violence, ""unexpected"" death, an imperfect king, etc.As for the problems and the conflicts: we all know what we'll find at the end of almost every scene..."
And all this with a disastrous script and zero meaningful acting.It's just a collection of boring medieval clichés (with a touch of fantasy elements) made from a lot of money.
"Major downgrade from the books and the previous show. The casting for the king is terrible as is his wig. The casting for the Velaryons is jarring. Literal black people pretending to be white people. Awful wigs looks like characters are wearing a mop or amateur cosplayers. The black characters are unsurprisingly not real characters. No one points out their blackness, while every other character is attacked for their defining traits immediately in the first episode (eg. The King for being weak, Otto hightower for being a widower).The dragons have had a huge downgrade from the previous show. They are colorful like power rangers but that's where the positives end. Their animations are limited and stiff. Their flying animations are odd and twisting. The camera intentionally avoids close ups because of laziness to detail their bodies. They stand out in every scene they are in for how fake they look. They don't behave like giant reptiles. They are just slaves to their masters doing exactly what they're supposed to with no free will unlike Drogon in Game of Thrones--who had an attitude with his master and did things she didn't approve.The timejump idea and replacement of young actors with olders ones is stupid, a clear indication that the showrunners are rushing the story. It is poorly executed with only some actors being replaced. It completely undoes the viewers bond and identification with the characters.The violence is so fake and forced, especially in episode 1. It is not clear whether the kingsguard are killing innocents or criminals, and the shock factor is very surface level since we do not get any screentime with the victims to humanize them. We barely see their faces, and then they are killed. It's a failed attempt to be violent like the original show but without the humanizing factors that actually elicit a response from the audience."
"Three episodes in and I feel like I'm trying really hard to like House of the Dragon. I'm not giving up on it just yet, but it's not getting any better week to week.The problems:"
"Exposition over and over and over again. There's so much ground to cover given that the Dance of the Dragons story from Fire and Blood covers decades. The show has chosen to skip over a lot of the story, which is probably for the best but having characters we barely know explain things about other characters we barely know over and over again is wearing thinthe characters we do know are deeply uninteresting and unlikeable. I'm all for complex characters but there has to be someone we're rooting for, even if they're doing awful things. Having read the Dance of the Dragons I think we probably should be rooting for the regular folks of Westeros but we're not seeing any of them yet.the dialogue is incredibly boringGame of Thrones was very good (more so in the earlier seasons) of introducing characters and quickly making you fall in love with them, mostly by using George's dialogue from the books.Remember Ned and Cat's first scenes or the scene where we first meet Tywin? And Littlefinger and Varys's throne room scenes. All just a few minutes but so much ground is covered and so much connection between us and the characters.I was looking forward to how House of the Dragon would show the changes in Rhaenyra and Alicent over the years but as it hasn't done a great job of really helping us get to know them as they are now, I'm not feeling confident.the CGI is really poorthe Volume might be a really exciting piece of technology but the effect here looks so incredibly fake that it's jarring. The scenes at Dragonstone looked like matte painted scenes from the 1940s and 50s - impressive at the time but a clear backwards step from the visual effects of Game of Thrones.Plot armourThe battle scenes in episode 3 were some of the most exciting of the series so far. But with little investment in most of the characters, and Daemon wearing plot armour so thick that out of a thousand arrows only a couple made it through, I found myself pretty unengaged despite the addition of a new dragon.The positives for me are unfortunately mostly playing on the nostalgia for the original series.The music as always is fantastic. The opening credit scene is also beautifully done. And the costumes are beautifully detailed (although the wigs are often questionable)I'm still hopeful that we'll get an engaging story but the final seasons of Game of Thrones showed that when we don't understand or care about the characters, it's really tough to tell a satisfying story no matter how many battles or dragons you throw at it."
"I had been giving huge quantities of benefit-of-the-doubt to House of the Dragon. But after watching, or enduring, tedious episode after exhausting episode, honestly, my patience is finally gone. Some of its biggest faults lie in the nonsensical time flow of the show as well as the fact that there is not one single likable character.This show is rushing to a future that, even after a couple time jumps, never seems to arrive. It is both moving too fast and not at all. The TV equivalent of someone that talks so much yet says so little.As the timeline of the show moves forward, some characters are recasted while others are not. What this means for the non existing story is that, some characters decompose into old age, others seem to age in a way that doesn't make sense and a third group stays perfectly young and untouched by time. This is so glaringly bad that it almost feels like an intentional middle finger to the audience while saying ""people will watch anything.""Game of Thrones had its claws in its audience because it had qualities that House of the Dragon is missing: strong, distinct and likable characters; gripping plot lines, some irreverence, lots of wit, black humour, scope, imagination, heart and soul. Dragon does have some beautifully composed shots. At moments, I found myself thinking ""wow, I don't remember game of thrones looking this good/having these type of artistic shots.""Dragon is a boring soap opera with a medieval skin and lazy writing that includes several lazy plot devices and tv tropes. The GOT connection almost feels forced at this point, just there to capitalize on its success.It feels like it's created its own version of the most recent MCU formula, a self-aware money-grab, betting on the people that will rationalize the bad writing as part of the story. A story that is always leading to the next one but never quite satisfies, knowing that audiences will indeed watch anything."
"I'm not sure who decided to write this garbage, but jousting tournaments were not a blood bath where the contestants murdered each other to the cheers of the crowd and knights openly cheated with no one batting an eye.In such tournaments, knights often used blunted weapons and there were clear rules to prevent the contestants from getting killed. It was never a fight to the death. Death happend rarily, thanks to the durability of a knights armor.Lords send their sons to gain glory, if this many contestants died, they would run out of sons pretty quickly and would gain many reasons to go to war with the people who killed their sons.Game of Thrones treated its viewers like intelligent human beings. Knights getting killed was something out of the ordinary, attacking your opponent to unhorse them was not acceptable.House of the Dragon treats us like morons. Thats probably also why they want us to accept that Westeros now looks like New York."
"I first reviewed this when episode one came out and, well, wasn't too impressed by it. I thought that perhaps the second episode would do a better job, but it only further emphasized the huge problems this show has.The first one is that these characters aren't particularly interesting at the storytelling is advancing at a breakneck pace. To put it into perspective, we could more or less say a year of storytelling took place in a single season of GoT, whereas here the expectation seems to be that the period from episode to episode can vary everywhere from months to years. This brings a severe disconnect to the viewer, and I think it's going to have big issues when the characters people love now (God, I don't know what for) will be killed off and replaced.A big problem for me personally are the look and feel of the show, as well as the worldbuilding. GoT is not set in some vague place, it's been established. When D&D originally set out to make that show based on GRRM's writing, everybody involved knew it was not-England. To be sure GoT spiced it up sometimes with eastern-inspired armors and other similar things, but it always tried to stay at least quasi-historical. HotD has completely thrown this out the window. What we see here are vast, totally surreal and unrealistic landscapes, combined with fantasy interiors that not only make no sense, but which in no way resemble GoT. Again, we have seen these places before, so why couldn't there have been some effort put into consistency? HotD goes for the rule-of-cool in a show where it doesn't fit and where it's completely at odds with the soap-ish tone they're going for.Lastly, the writing is excruciating. I'm not even talking a failure in the narrative or huge plot holes, but scene-to-scene character dialogue."
"I gave this show a solid try. First episode was so boring I kept falling asleep every time I'd put it on. On the 3rd attempt I finished the episode. The second episode was better then I almost bowed out when they were bordering on incest sex in a whorehouse. That story turned around and I thought it was sone for good.Then, right when I finally am somewhat borderline into the show, they marry the princess to a black, gay, white haired dude. Next episode has a cast change. Time jump 10 years and they recast several of the female main cast but keep all the dudes. The first episode opens with a five minute birthing scene that was just boring, gross, annoying, all the things. Alicent I prefer the new actress but the other changes are terrible.Officially done. Full incest sex scene halfway through an episode so dark you literally can not see anything on the screen.I draw the line at incest sex scenes. I turned it off and never again. I only made it this far (1/2 way thru episode 7) because I hated GOT almost till the end of season 1 & after that loved it for the next few seasons. I almost stopped watching because of the incest on that show, not getting creeped out by that again."
"The most ridiculous show you'll ever watch. I think the writers just took key elements from GoT and decided to write around it. This is more of a soap opera revolving around family drama. The characters keep changing just how daenyrs's character changed all of a sudden the last season on GoT.There's no cohesiveness on any subject. So many unexplained scenes. As a viewer I was left baffled and quite bored to be honest.Even after watching the entire 1st season, I don't know what the actual story was about and who were the characters.Also, the sudden need to change acrors for only certain characters was so strange.I can't believe Im saying this but this is actually worse than the last season of GoT."
"GoT loyalists cant avoid HoD... its a compulsion, an obligation, a point of no return ... Above all why not watch it when 20 Million ppl are watching it..."
But dont expect any thing more from it other than its kinship with GoT
It has nothing much to offer
Story seems like a class assignment of RR Martins intern
Its no where near GoT as
"1. Plot is uni-directional, monotonous and boring"
2. Charactor arching is so weak that you wont give a damn to whatever is happening to key cast members
"3. Casting is so poor that the king looks like a commoner, princess looks like a peasent and Lords look like unpaid extras"
4. They claim that they are spending gazzilons of $s but you wont find where...special effects are so pathetic and cinematography is so ordinary.5. Prince Daemon cant come and rescue every where
YOU MISS GoT WELL CONTIUE DOING THAT AS
GoT HAD
"Guilty pleasures of Lanisters with wisdom of tyrian,"
"Charisma of Jhon & Araya,"
"Majic of Red woman,"
"Friendship of Samy, Barron & Brian,"
"Cringe of Joffery & Ramsy Bolton,"
"Raw Khal Drogo & Prince Oberyn,"
THE RED WEDDING & so much more
IF YOU COME TO house of Dragons for your GoT Nostalgia you would be disappointed to say the least ..
"I loved the original series, this one is rushed and poorly executed. I mean the aged characters look nothing like or act like. I mean in the original striking a noble at a party would be death and to bring a hand back that was dishonored, not likely. They tried and failed to honor the original, kings guard taking orders from people not the king...laughable. There is some comparison from this to the original but it just falls dramatically short of what it could have been. If you are a true fan of this franchise it'll almost make you sick to watch this. HBO and George R. R. Martin should be ashamed."
"This series is pushed. Nothing about it is moving in any particular way. The characters are lacking. Everything is rushed. The structure of the show doesn't flow well. The only reason I've watched is for the connection to GoT. Otherwise, it's hard to even immerse yourself in the world with all the horrible wigs and subpar CGI.The final episode did finally feel as though something of substance was actually happening but the drawn out build up for nothing but a cliffhanger left me feeling compelled to abandon spending any more time watching this series or franchise moving forward.It's a shame when art becomes more about business and money."
"Literally NOBODY ages in this show except king Viserys, it's a joke. He looks like he is 110 years old in episode 8 and everybody else (except maybe the kids) hasnt aged a day.In the books, the Targaryens are always described as exceptionally beautiful but they r all ugly except some of the women. I really dont understand why the story never accords to the books. It is a total different story.And it is not even about the dragons! They play no role in the show called HOUSE OF THE DRAGONThe dialogs are long and boring, i fell asleep in each of the first 3 episodes. There is so much content that plays absolutely no role in the whole story.The potential was there but just like the last seasons of GOT it went the wrong direction."
"I am hugely disappointed. All the warmth or the plot that circles around different characters of the story is all gone out the window. Everything is forced. The plot...doesn't hook you and it makes no sense. Even if we all know the outcome. And if the only thing you need to watch is the recap to get the story...then its really bad. Thats really bad.I am, as you can read, very disappointed. And with all that money...they rush it? I can almost hear the executives saying...get it out! Work faster!...."
"With all that money it stills prove that you cant buy everything with cash. If you don't have an engaging red line to follow and getting people want to see more. Then you have failed. Doesn't matter how much money you poor into it. You still need heart and warmth about the characters and story. In my mind they made a big mistake here and tanked big.That being said, all the things money can buy looks good though. Like the CGI's and the decor."
"Not nearly as good as the original, but started off great. Then half way through the season it just went off the rails. Just as the storyline got good it decided to fast forward multiple times and creatively have the darkest scenes for some reason to the point you could barely see what was even going on. Finale just summed up the season... good start, poor finish.If you watch the first episode of the original, you'll see more action, storyline and intrigue than the entire first season of this show. Hopefully the next season will be better, but the series is definitely off to a rocky start...."
I couldn't even finish half of the episode. I even sped forward sometime. In GOT i used to go backwards so many times to enjoy the scene. Anyway very disappointing start. I think I will not continue the show for now. Good luck all.
"I was giving this poor series a chance till the 09th episode. When princes Rhaenys flew with her dragon without blowing up the ""Aegon"" and crew, I knew. I knew the project team sucks. Unlike GOT when it first comes, Now these people need to keep characters ""alive"". Why? During the entire season they was not able to highlight any strong character. And they want us to like these ""con"" characters. I personally see the whole series empty and failure, less thriller compared to GOT, no suspense at all, all predictable, week plot. And I amaze to see these high praises over HOD. Please think several times before create the second series."
"On the strength of the first four episodes, this is nothing more than a medieval royal succession drama viewed from a female perspective and tarted up with some CGI dragons. It's predictable, not particularly engaging and the dialogue is often stilted and cliched. None of the main characters are especially likeable or memorable and the wigs are ridiculous. It delivers nothing much of interest except the female perspective of being married off to secure diplomatic goals. There's nothing wrong with that. However, the same process also applied to males and the series displays absolutely no interest in the wretched lives of peasants, female or male, who are there to be used by royalty and the nobility as playthings. Essentially, it's 'poor little princess' with high production values, CGI and a ponderous, self-important script."
"This is definitely a money-grab. Shame that this impotent stuff borrows its name from GoT. All the humor, wit, creativity and suspense are gone. Boring script, endless dialogues about nothing, flat characters that do not evolve at all, useless blood out of context, actions not pushing the story forward, rather making it even more boring, dark picture, unimpressive playing, bad cast. Oh dear the main actress can't play anything, she's trying to cry sometimes to be able to show sadness, but even there her face end eyes do not change. The overall intrigue is so miserable that you can stop and go whenever you want at any moment of the show."
"Absolutely no depth . No interesting characters and basically filmed in 2 rooms . It's a glorified drama trying to ride on GOT success .Every episode seems to jump years and can't keep but think I just don't care for any of the characters.The whole movie is basically just about the princess and the kings brother, no other branches and stories, 7 episodes in and still really no further forward apart from 2 people wanting to be together but simply can't , it's Romeo and Juliet with a game of thrones spin to it and utterly fails with poor writing and productionIt's a shame as I wanted it good."
"Could not help but come up with this comparison, since my Escurio experience is fresh. You start with certain expectations, based on what all other Davidoffs delivered through the years, yet realizing this is something different, you keep an open mind. And it is just few puffs later, you begin to realize this would be nothing like the Davidoffs you are familiar with and most probably won't be a very enjoyable experience either. Still, you go on and about the second third things start to get better, so you think, okay, it picks up now, not bad, not bad. Then the final third kicks in, it gets way worse than it started and nothing you have hoped for. So you just throw it away without finishing and off goes the god damn disappointment. And this show ie exactly that. Illusive package, filled with contradicting content that is not worth your time, let alone money."
"What is this house of still borns! But no fans will call it good writing, your all so easily pleased! See a dragon and omg let's give the episode a 10. I waited 10 episodes for the only death to be 1 of rheas kids, oh and a crab man. Do you know why got wasn't scared, because they had several story lines and so many great actors/tresses and that also kept you interested if you didn't like one. We have 1 story line here. Got broke it up, the wall, walkers, drogos clan, and how many different families did we meet! I'm definitely not going to be an idiot and rate it a 1 because clearly a lot of work has gone into it and they will never top Got but i certainly won't be thinking ""i cant wait for season 2""."
"I can't drink enough to ignore those terrible VFX shots. I know games with better graphics. I guess they ran out of money? If the VFX is bad, just blur it and put some dust in front.Sadly doesn't work, because the grade looks flat and video-ish. I am desperately searching for anything cinematic. Couldn't find it .Really disappointed"
"About the story: can't concentrate on it, it just looks so cheap!!!"
"The show is horrible. Whoever wrote the script needs to leave the industry. The storyline is focused on teenager who's acting like little child and gets mad at her daddy but for some reason deserves to be a queen ""to fight patriarchy"" (what?). Daddy, who's a king, sacrifices his loving wife for interests of kingdom in first episode and then in next 2 episodes he doesn't give a damn about kingdom and all what he's focused on is to make sure his daughter is not in fussy mood. After watching 3 episodes of the show I still can not understand who are the characters and why I'm supposed to love or hate any of them since they're always inconsistent in their behavior. I will not be watching this show again, 2 stars for costumes as that's the only thing that is decent in this show."
"Nothing much is happening. Again, like in many other series, it is merely emo emo and more emo. Where's the action? Talk is cheap...and I'm not buying any! Not a patch on GOT!Weak acting and actors. No plot yet after 5 episodes. Where are the writers going with this? I wish producers wouldn't do spin offs of series as there's not ever been one that is equal or better than the original.And where are the dragons? Also, the clothing and hair and the wigs look cheap.I hope it will get better...soon... or I may stop watching. Maybe one season will suffice. When is winter coming? I've said enough..."
"You could tell from the visual opening credits that GOT was something special and grand. The beginning of the HOTD has no memorable opening, no sense that an epic story is about to unfold and no compelling characters.Perhaps the acting will improve as the storyline moves forward but hardly anyone in E1 has distinguished themselves in that regard.Don't know what mood the show runners were going for but dark, fuzzy lighting will only take the storyline so far. Hopefully, we'll see the characters in the light of day every so often."
"The word that comes to mind is hollow. There is too much CGI, too much violence and not enough interesting characters in our introduction to this world. The actors do well with the the material they have but they do not portray characters that I want to see more of. There is no depth to this world like there was in Game of Thrones. I will continue to watch for a while but there is no sense of mystery here, nothing to foreshadow or keep the audience invested in figuring out. So if you watched Game of Thrones just for the battle and sex scenes (and the dragons) this show may be for you. But if you loved the storytelling and world creation (of the first seasons anyway), I'm afraid House of the Dragon is not going to satisfy."
"This show was an attempt to cash in on the popularity of Game of Thrones but it falls short. It is not as good as the original Game of Thrones. Second-rate actors, a lot of sex scenes, the obligatory political correctness, overuse of the F word, and a really poor story line. This seems to be the trend with many directors and writers who think this improves the story, but it does the opposite. There is more time spent on showing the details of someone having sex or cutting out togues than there is on the story. Many scenes are so dark you can hardly see some scenes unless you turn off all ambient light and even than it is hard to see. Overall, the show is slow and really does not pick up until Episode 7. You can fast forward through the first 6 episodes and hardly miss anything. The series will put many people to sleep. Maybe it is a show for people starving for entertainment, but for most it is simply not good."
"It's like watching a really bad movie on the syfy network. Bad writing, bad acting, I expected a lot more from this show. It's like a terrible soap opera set at a renaissance fair. Maybe it can get better but if the last few seasons of hot have taught us anything, it's that HBO writers are good at thinking for themselves."
"Just another suck of the sav, trying to recapture the 'magic' of GoT s01-04... failed, unimpressive acting and script, 1 hour and two minutes of my life wasted."
"Was interesting to be back to Westeros and the GoT setting. But was a few things that made the show feel okay, but not great.1. The pacing off the first episode felt off, it jumped from scene to scene quite fast without time to linger on the scene or what happened, each scene felt like it was fast forwarded or parts were cut out. Giving you no real time to care or process what happened as now it was somewhere else.2. Without the names from GoT and slight view of dragons, it didn't feel like it was set in the same ""universe"". Just that they tossed out names to make you feel ""Oh I know that one"". It didn't feel like I was watching GoT , more that I watched a generic fantasy and someone kept telling me it was something else. World didn't have the same weight or atmosphere, no tension and felt more like a quick copy, while the person hadn't seen GoT before and had to do a story from what he has heard of it.3. The visual is beautiful... But also feel so much like CGI or polished with it that parts are like watching a game or you immediately tell its fake that take you out of immersion, something GoT didn't have issue with. Even just gazing around the Citadel and buildings, something just felt cgi of it, like they polished it up too much4. Shock value scenes were... Not wow. Even if former had these shock value scenes, these ones felt like a cheap version they tossed in to fill runtime and then as mentioned before, speeded it up so you don't actually get to be in the moment and process it5. Asked to care about characters, when you barely know them or they've had so little runtime so you go ""Okay"" when something bad happens. Not asking for that you must be emotionally invested immediately to every character, but when you barely know one, they had no impact to the story yet, then asked to care when something happens. You just don't--Tho it wasn't bad, just decent. Still worth a watch and hopefully next episodes become better."
"Okay let's start with the basics story, So we have a King that dies and names his heir to the throne, And of course someone doesn't like it now that King has to name his heir to the throne and guess what someone doesn't like it....yawn same old.Please don't get me started on the treatment of white men. It just seems to me that any white male in the show is treated as some sort of idiot or weak. Where are the Jon Snow characters that made Game of Thrones great, oh sorry, we're not allowed to have men looking stronger than women nowadaysBut on top of that absolutely no likable characters in this and I can tell that's not really going to change, GOT episode one you did actually realise that you were going to like these characters but in the show I don't care if any of them die.So basically no original story and unlikable characters obviously it's my opinion but I've seen the same review quite a few times on here.And really 10 out of 10 reviews obviously people have never watched any TV before."
"I didn't expect it to be as good as Game of Thrones but I was expecting the same type of show. However, I think hbo went for something that would appeal to/be suitable for teens. Doing what disney and sometimes streaming services do which is make teens the main target audience and count on adults watching because of the popularity of the story it's based off. Problem with this is the plot, script and characters all get dumbed down and for many adults it's just not good enough. I'm so disappointed. I found it hard to maintain interest. So it's not even just the fact it's been dumbed down/simplified and self censored for a younger audience it is clearly poorly written. I now fear all the spin offs in the works will follow this same formula of an M rating (GoT was rated 18+) to maximise profits with boring characters and a badly told story."
"The beginning was decent. Creates some intense and exciting drama - the Queen gets some disturbing news, could'nt wait to see what the outcome would be... Ah 10 years later new actors for some roles, few has aged and some didnt age a bit over 10 years. Oh and the exciting plot? Yeah no outcome to that, they just carried on as usual and now you got a hole pack of kids and their different fathers that you have no clue who is. I felt GOT took the time to introduce characters and the settings, but this is overall just confusing.Absolutely horrible spin off, i am definately not gonna waste time on season 2."
"Both literally and metaphorically, where the hell are the dragons? Halfway through the season, the only thing I have seen are dialogues and none that will be remembered. It's not even clear what story we're following and to what end. There are almost no fights, no suspense whatsoever, no -even remotely- likable characters, non-existing motives, just shallow shallow replications of Game of Thrones. They didn't even compose a new score for this series. There are scenes in episode 4 and 5 that make no sense and you don't even understand what's going on. I really expected more from HBO and I'm utterly disappointed."
"The first episode was incredibly boring, it was completely like I ended up in the middle of a soap opera where everyone has already slept with everyone else, has children with them and is now groping about who had the most adventurous sex."
It's a lame attempt to create something similar to GoT. And yes people are going to compare HoTD with GoT. I think HBO wanted to earn after GoT ended so they rushed for this one!!What's wrong with the casting director? I know beauty is subjective but they should cast main characters a little bit more attractive and not unconventional looking. They acted well!! All actors no doubt about it and we cannot forget as well that looks matter when it comes to visual medium and honestly they failed or I would say people couldn't connect with the characters!!And WHY??Because of poor direction and screenplay!! Say whatever about David Benioff and D. B. Weiss but they were able to maintain a good and gripping story throughout 8 seasons regardless of brainless ending and unnecessary s*x scenes!! People connected with the characters and the story was captivating and exciting from first episode. In GoT the choice of directors was good!! HoTD directors just copy and pasted GoT!!And obviously the story is boring and writing/screenplay is poor!!Some actors were really god. The actor who played 'Viserys I' did a great job especially the old age part!! Olivia Cooke is my favourite so I am biased!!I hope second season will be good!! GoT was original that's why it had a global reach!! Few movies or series can create this magic!!
"The series seriously suffers from pace and the lack of a impending threat. There is no mystery or magic behind all the ""House of Cards"" politics to keep you hooked. Not even the dragons are explored correctly and given much importance. Sets and situations feel flat, repetitive and don't translate to the screen what the iron throne really meant or its scale. And exactly when you're starting to care for characters and things start to get warm we get a time jump out of the blue with part of the cast replaced, key characters left in the pst and everything is basically reset and goes back to the same lukewarm political drama without many stakes that isn't enough to keep you hooked.The fact that we kind of know where all of this will lead doesn't help much either. But I was certainly expecting a universe as broad as the original, and instead we got a castle, no magic, no mystery, cheap family drama, slow politics, dragons that feel ordinary, all with bland characters.Let's see how this will develop after this time jump break, but so far it is disappointing at best."
"35 minutes through the first episode & I found myself thinking about preparing for work the next day. It's just ok, not intriguing, not different, pretty much bog standard... Rhys Evans is the best character so far, the rest are just trying to hard... But then following GOT is pretty impossible?!... I'll carry on with it but come on IMDb, it's not worth over 9/10..."
"Just remember the 1st episode of GoT. The cast gathers at Winterfell. Mark. Addy, Sean Bean and the family that already showed they were fully formed characters. This, well its a mess, blonde wigs flowing all over the screen. Sorry to say it about a guy doing his best but Matt Smith is no. Emila Clarke. The dragons fly all in and out, the lesson always in story telling, keep your ace for when its spectacular. Maybe I'm being very unfair, I hope so, I'd love this to be another special TV classic. Its the lines written fr he actors that are of most concern. Some way, some how it must improve. For sure cash, lots and lots of cash has been thrown at the show."
"Promoters were very good at promoting but that's their job after all. I couldn't find anything original or mildly watch worthy in the new HOTD series? Why? It felt as if they merely cut and pasted old GOT scenes in the wrong order and then simply replaced the actors. The new characters also appear to be one pixel away from being digitized. The rest? Where to begin?Same places, language and dress. There's a flying dragon (no surprise there), Lots of maidens, courtesans and princesses etc. Knights in not so shiny armor and last but not least, there's the bad villain!So to summarize..... it's too long on mutilations, beheadings, castrations etc., but woefully short on originality and smart storytelling. Plenty of bloodlust and gore for the sadistic viewer and very little for everyone else."
"Bot manipulated ratings rant:This is not a 10 or anywhere close despite 46% of reviews claiming it is. Bot farm manipulation has become so bad that its not even subtle anymore. You can tell the overall rating is not accurate just by reading through reviews, since most bots aren't complex enough to leave thoughtful reviews. And the majority of detailed reviews are, like myself, disappointed in the content.Onto the review:I have been a fan and avid reader of the books since the 90s. Like most I loved the books and enjoyed the GoT series which captured the vibrant world and its colorful characters fairly well. This on the other hand gives me no feeling whatsoever. I wanted very much to like it but its just, blah.The packaging was enticing, but the content was regrettably bland. I don't care about any of the characters. The story is wearisome and uninteresting. There is no substance whatsoever. I wanted it to be good. I kept trying to tell myself that next episode it will get better. Ended up wasting hours of my life that I will never get back.I will admit I set high standards. I honestly recommend watch one episode. If you liked the first episode maybe you will like it, but if you found it boring from the start like me, don't bother continuing hoping it will get better (it doesn't)."
"I don't understand how with such a budget, access to the best in the industry, it could turn out sooooo badly. The sound is so badly mixed and speech so mumbled and muffled you needed subtitles.Some characters age and some don't, some characters just become unrecognisable because a different actor suddenly turns up playing the character. The plot storyline and character development was only up to daytime to standards sometimes falling short of even that low bar. Many dreary episodes where nothing ,nothing happens. Boredom set in around episode five and once bored I started to be aware of the sheer drudgery of the snail paced plot. No grand scale here, just a few disparate locations seemingly unconnected to one another.If you haven't yet watched it, do yourself a favour..... DONT it is truly awful."
"Poor casting decisions, the storyline is a little tired - there really is nothing special about this new series that the initial GOT had. I would have liked to see them explore the land behind the wall, introduce a new family and their story - something other than a gothic inspired Succession re-tread.... glad so many other reviewers liked it, but I'm out."
"I am updating my review again and you can see a previously updated one below. I also reduced my rating from 9 to 7 then 2 and it will stay here. This show already has a hard time giving us charismatic characters but then episode 6 happened. The new actors are less charismatic than the first ones. Why change the actors when it's only 10 years later and they were not that young to begin with? Imagine changing the actors who originally played Tyrion Lannister or Jon Snow in game of thrones. What a bad idea! I used to like Olivia Cooke, especially in Bates Motel but she's just plain horrible in House of dragon. She just mumbles with that fake British accent. She's just not in her element here and her face looks like she's scared to death all the time. The violence in this happens randomly for no reason because they feel like the audience wants it from time to time. And what's up with all the child deliveries? 6 episodes in and a already 3 ok 4. How about some epic battles instead? I know if people wanted to go back and update their ratings, the general rating wouldn't be this high on IMDb.Old review: After watching the second episode, I lowered my rating by 2 points. The acting, production, cinematography feel cheaper than GOT. Either you go for it or don't do it at all. Usually, prequels or sequels seem cheaper than the originals and I am starting to see that. This is as far as my comparison with GOT will go. I'm not one of those who want to see the old in the new. Of course we are not yet familiar with the characters in HOD so some might be tempted to say they don't feel a bond with the characters but I remember being totally confused after watching the first episode of GOT and couldn't figure out who was who.I believe the gore and sex scenes are a little too forced. The action scenes are top notch and well choreographed when there are some. The second episode had too much talking and got boring. The fact that RR Martin is still involved is a relief and the reason all the details fit so well to explain what would be to come in GOT.I don't know if the same studio provided the CGI animation but I find the dragons in HOD a little more video game looking that the ones in GOD. Also, I'm black and black people want justice and equality but we are not asking to see black people everywhere where they are not likely to be. We don't need to be blond among Nordic people from the middle age. It's getting ridiculous.The icing on the cake is the soundtrack. Ramon Djawadi back for it. We hear different music with hints of the first GOT soundtrack that helps keeps the familiarity with the ambiance intact."
"It's just very rushed, so there's not much story. They try to make up for that with shock value with multiple babies/children dying and blood and gore. Big budget with nothing behind it.If you do choose to watch it make notes as you go. It rushes through so quick that it's hard to remember all the names and who is connected to who. So unless you're a GoT super fan who reads the books you will need assistance to keep up.Oh and there is massive issues with the continuity in this show. Years will pass, some characters will age, and others won't. It doesn't make any sense.So give it a watch if you want, but I promise you won't be satisfied and you will likely have a bunch of questions for the creators."
"When I first heard of a series on HBO called Game of Thrones, I thought I'd dislike it. I was SO wrong! In the very first episode, I was hooked! The characters were interesting and appealing! The story started off with gripping actions. We were introduced to the royal family, dire wolves, and relationships between friends and family. And it ended with a shocking scene as Ser Jamie did the unthinkable. All in the first episode!That was a hard act to follow, but Game of Thrones continued to grab my interest with every episode.So, I was excited to know there would be a prequel.What a disappointment. The characters are rather boring and poorly acted. The story line is uninteresting. Even the dragons aren't as exciting. They look odd, not fierce, like those in GoT.I waited for 5 episodes before writing this, hoping that it would improve. It hasn't. I'd rather watch reruns of the original for the umpteenth time, that watch this series.I'm beyond disappointed. I truly miss the original cast, the excellent writing, the intrigue.... This series is just plain boring. It's a soap opera with dragons.BTW, the idea of the balls when checking into small council meeting is REALLY stupid! They can simply look up to see who is and isn't there. Yet another indication of the poor writing. This series is worse than bad. And they always seem to film on overcast days. Gloomy like the entire show. I'm done. I can't take another episode.I DID watch to the end of season 1. The last 2 episodes were much better. There MAY be hope for Season 2."
"No where as good as GAME OF THRONES, this series is slow,dimly lit and boring. If it went any slower it would stop. The first eight episodes are very disappointing in every aspect. It keeps jumping from character to character, thinking thta it is 200 years before the coming of Game of Thrones not a lot of progress was made in the way of inventions! You would have thought progress would have been made in weapons,transport etc,but no it is still the same. Anyway not impressed. It was so boring I stopped half way through episode eight . Cast are wooden ,some are trying to hard (Matt Smith) He makes me laugh when he tries to be evil,cant help but see Dr Who."
"Problem 1: The show is so desperate for worshiping Targeryans and the airhead shallow character Rhaenyra.Problem 2: Rhaenyra turns out to be a low and cheap version of Daenerys, but doesn't have her charisma and her goal is pointless.Problem 3: in the eagerness to highlight female character, almost all the men are portrayed as dumb, evil, idiots, except the ones who support the girls. You can highlight the girls without destroying the male characters, like GOT did, but the series chooses the other approach.Problem 4: as a consequence of problem 3, the main members of the other houses are so poor characters. Everyone is reduced to a idiot and there will be always a unatural situations in which they will ""insult"" the overspoiled Rhaenyra. And they rarely show up on the episodes.Who watched GOT 'cause likes the super intersting characters, many fun house leaders making big moves in the game, perfect dialogues that fits the context, many point of views with some good different reasons, charismatic men and women, you won't have it on HOTD. Any Targeryan there doesn't have 10% of the appeal of Danny or Meistre Aemon. But if you just want a girls centered history at any cost or just loves the Targeryans house in any circunstances, you'll probably like it."
"HBO should have left well enough alone. Any connection between this and GOT would be a huge accident. You can find no reason to care about these cardboard characters. If there is a story being told here, it is well and truly buried. Lots of blood and guts for those who appreciate mindless violence. Uninteresting and unsympathetic characters. You are well-advised to give this a miss. HBO now translates as: Hugely Boring Offerings! I'm done with this!It is unbelievable that any number of individuals can, possibly, rate this rubbish as even marginally interesting, let alone worth watching. So, either those watching are solely interested in mindless blood and gore with zero plot or acting; or, there is something questionable about how ratings are calculated."
Have watched two episodes and doubt if I will finish the remainder of the season. Just because it's touted as a prequel to the Game of Thrones it's no where near as good. Acting is also not that great either. Don't know who thought of another series of Game of Thrones with different actors was a good thing. For some reason when I was watching them speak some other strange language the subtitles were in that language and not English like the rest of the show. The families in this show are probably more disfunctional than in the Game of Thrones.What I'd like to know is why I have to type 600 characters in my review ot this show as well. It's not that great. Which is why I only gave it 1 star out of 10. It would be nice if you showed how many characters I've typed so far so that I can know when to stop.
"This seems to lack the same punch as the original GOT, I think its the characters...I don't think they are believable, the acting is okay but it doesn't make me impatient to see the next episode. The characters are all ...meh...."
"I have to admit I have read all the books and loved the GOT series, even if the last few years were rushed they aren't as predictable as this.I always thought of the dragon riders and they whole race as more than human, almost even elf like...unhuman, but these guys are as boring as their subjects. I will keep watching and hoping but I've lost interest already to be honest and if this is G RR's work I will skip on the next few books."
"I have completed all the 9 episodes so far and I can definitely say I'm not all excited or thrilled for the finale. In fact I don't care how the season is going to end, the writers of the show have done such a bad job.There is no character development, the story is predictable; it's like watching a paint drying. To make matters worse, there's no chemistry between the characters so you don't feel connected to the show. The conversations between the characters are boring. The only positive point about the show is the performance of Milly Alcock as the young Rhaenyra Targaryen and Emily Carey as Queen Alicent. They were really good. They should've worked more on the character development and writing rather than VFX.But do not watch this show, instead watch the first 4 seasons of GoT again."
"It just of Bold & Beautiful with fancy customs.Characters are bland.Cast is mediocreDialogs are boring and tedious.Story line is one dimensional and predictable. Yes, the brother has a claim on the throne and yes this will lead to a conflict and yes the protagonist is stronger than people think...Filmography & animations are badand most of all (and i think this is the most frustrating part) are"
"the fake reviews on IMDB which hype up the whole thing but eventually you need to curb your enthusiasm.So, I personally think that HBO should have invested in a better quality entertainment, as they are hoping to increase their user base. This is not the way forward, if you ask me."
"Because its kind of prequel of ""Games of Throne"" its evident that must be compariston between this series. So i find ""House of Dragons"" a little bit like weak echo of the original idea and series. Stay no strong characters, no action, dialogs a little bit too ""freudian"" and problems of autority are simply too boring. Even actors are ""second hand"". I can't feel ""medieval touch"" of ""House of Dragons"". And richness of screen technology cant override lack of good ideas and long and boring dialogs.Somebody tried to make a good COPY of ""Game of Thrones"" and he failed.To me its very spectacular and big failure."
"Even though there are a few good moments, this basically is a far cry from all the people talking about wokeness. It fails miserably to have any intersectional depth. Just the over used trope of how hard it is to be a woman of privilege or a man of honor.I have found no character in this series that is worthy of respect nor deserving of my support. It is simply a highly over produced and underwritten series.I was interested at first. But every episode shows a pettiness inherent to every one of the characters that it makes it difficult to care. I don't think the time jump did any favors.I see how much it sets everything to a civil war that is nothing more than intrafamilial strife. Whose butt gets to get rust infections on the iron throne?"
"It was unfortunately a very poor, BBC style version of Game of Thrones.It had potential granted, but certain acting and casting choices were very poor.GOT actors were on point, you felt immersed and part of the adventure whomever's scene it was.House of Dragon actors always seemed like they were, acting.The surroundings were very uninspiring and same old.GOT had an abundance of different terrains, characters and stories that ultimately interlinked.This did not have that In any real shape or form.Unfortunately though it was like taking control of Man Utd after Fergie.Nothing was probably going to quite stand up to expectations."
"The writing feels lackluster and uninspired, and the scenes often feel forced and devoid of any real emotional weight. The violence, while certainly present, feels gratuitous and doesn't serve to drive the story forward in any meaningful way. The acting, while not terrible, is nothing to write home about, and I find myself struggling to care about any of the characters.Overall, The House of the Dragon feels like a pale imitation of its predecessor. I can't help but feel like it's a waste of time. If you're a fan of the original Game of Thrones series, I'd recommend rewatching that instead. At least it had characters and storylines worth investing in."
"Three stars for sets. Was so looking forward to this, but no. Just NO! It is so dull, and all they talk about is the throne. The time jumping? Bad choice. Boring casting for the most part, and Matt Smith is just such a poor choice. He is such an overrated actor and I just want to laugh every time you're supposed to be wary of him. Also, he walks like he's been on a saddle too long. The writing is sub par, and if you watch the episodes in On Demand, where they have interviews with writers, producers and show runners after the episode, they are often condescending and talk about viewers ""paying attention"". I would if you'd written a decent show. Four episodes in and I am not remotely Interested in what happens to anyone of the very uncharasmatic characters. Unfortunately for them, GOT came first and I was hooked from S1 Ep1. This show pales by comparison, and there's no way not to compare. Buh-bye dragons... Zzzzzzzzz..."
"I was expecting, after I had written my observations, that I would be berated by screeching Song of Ice and Fire fanatics. It seems that concensus is in line with my own observations, to wit, that this is a lack-luster G. O. T. Wanna-be,, dang, two hypehenated words in a row.. sorry bout dat! In any case my observation is this is just a plastic copy of the original. The very first thing I noticed is the costumes. All perfect like they just came out of the.costume department. All without a scratch, blemish, or wrinkle. Now that's authenticity bub! From that point I was jaded I admit, but the rest of what I've watched, to e06, is following that trend. Does anyone remember an awful series called Reign that was supposed to be.taking place during the Mary Queen of Scots era, but the music was like Taylor Swift , costumes, for the 'royal gala's' was like a cheap high-school graduation gown etc. Well, this show is not quite as bad as that but if you're looking for Game of Thrones, that is how this will feel to you.. It's ok, It's cheap Americanized drivel but my friend, it aint no Game of Thrones, Not even remotely close."
"Boring drama with writing that lacks imagination. Characters are lifeless and are not developed in any meaningful way. Indeed, the abrupt change of actors in the middle of the season renders the entire series meaningless. Who is the princess's new paramour and why should we care about him or any of these new people who simply appear. And who cares about the children, they seem to have sprung from the earth with any character arc to draw in the watcher.It is not entirely clear why this slice of history is even meaningful in the larger story being told. Nothing Happens. There is not struggle of good over evil, no new momentous ideas shaping civilization, no technologies that will affect the fate of man. Just a few boring and apparently stupid people going about their daily life stilted by fear, greed, and self doubt.This whole thing should be cancelled. Or, call it ""General Hospital; The Beginning"". Don't waste your money - rewatch GOT or find something new and well written/produced."
"In the original book, there are many depictions of the dilemma of female heirs, including pain of fertility, matrilineal inheritance and stigmatization, but these are portrayed as if they do not exist in the TV series. Paternal inheritance is always superior to maternal inheritance in the medieval context and even today. Why was Aegon II's illegal children accepted to the lords and people, but not Rhaenyra's, simply because of hair color? All bad things happen just by accident, and I haven't seen such a ridiculous power games be4. The writers and directors explore the characters too thinly, but the actors play with many layers. Just like GOT, this kind of writing deserves its ending. GOT writers had no original plots to follow in the end so it sucked justifiably, but hod writers can screw it even with the good answers to copy in the book.Hats off to the costume props and makeup artists."
"I had high hopes for this when I first heard it was coming out. Yet almost from the off I had a bad feeling. The storyline is so boring, to the point where you just don't care what they are talking about. The characters are so uninteresting, that you can't be bothered to take the time to really invest in them. The lighting is so poor that most of the time you are just watching shadows moving around in the pitch black, with no idea about what is going on. The casting is also terrible, Olivia Cook is a good actress, but she's too soft and innocent to pull off a nasty and powerful Queen. Compare her to Lena Headey as Cersei and that is the difference between HOTD vs GOT. Sad to say I stopped watching halfway through as I found myself bored and not caring about what was going on."
"I am amazed at how horrible this show is. A complete lack of plot continuity, character development or originality. Tried to be like Game of Thrones to please the old fans, ended up with very few good moments but a bad incoherent incomplete nothing. Badly made, bad story, bad acting and detestable. You can't even blame it on the characters, everyone hated Goffrey but still loved the show. Your characters are terrible. They're villains in a way that's just annoying and nothing else. Because you gave them an identity that does not make sense because you never developed their character. Game of Thrones was special, there was moments in this show where I could have guessed I was watching turkish tv. How pitiful to represent yourselves like this."
"Wanted to love it but was disappointed. The deliberate pacing of the original GOT was lost here as if, ""Well, you know how these stories go so, let's get on with it."""
"While I was prepared for disappointment in the direction and story I did expect the same image quality as the original or as with any film included with Amazon Prime. What in the actual hell is going on? They've clearly filmed this with a completely different filter called ""monochromatic""."
"So far so bad. Very boring, I can see this being about a lot of badly written politics while injecting social justice ideas into a fantasy setting based on medieval times. This reminds me of season 7 and 8 of GoT where Martin didn't give enough story so the showrunners write it themselves but horribly. There was never an indepth story of Rhaenyra, shes a cheap Danny copy st this point. There was many if Targareyans that had back story beginnings that would make much better story. This is an Era that should be much more focused on war and conflict, over petty political drama. Game of Thrones was purposely created about political drama, hence the name. They are just trying to make a bad reboot, instead of an actual prequel. Review may change as the show goes on, but not getting hopes up."
"Now I saw 3 more episodes after the review below was written and dissaproved because it is not long enough... ridiculous request from the stupid people behind the application!In any case - it becomes more and more embarrassing!!!The real heroes, the dragons... are simply not there and the rest... so boring... I mean really boring and pointless...Seems like this whole saga... was written by a really really bad author and that the first great seasons of GOT... we're simply a mistake or a coincidence!I saw the first three chapters... even like some of the charecters (especially the princess and the King's brother...But this is NOT games of thrown and it only emphasises how share stupidity of the writers and the author killed the what could and should have been the best series ever.I believe that if there wasn't games of thrown before this one... then this one would have been wawoooooo... but this is not the case!This new one looks like a pale full uninteresting version of games of thrown...Even the real heroes, the dragons do not look like the dragons in games of thrown...Sorry but NO!"
"I want my money back for my subscription to HBO MAX for this terrible bait and switch show. It has nothing to do with GOT! This show is dark, boring, low budget trash. The characters are pathetic and boring. The story is non existent. For 4 episodes we have jumped 4 or 5 years and nothing still is happening. The princess is unattractive and unlikeable. Matt Smith is acting the same as he was in The Crown. Boring!!! Then last night the episode is entirely about sex. Who cares! I need wars! Evil Queens! Shocking weddings, revenge! The final scene last night was the princess upset by her cup of tea. Seriously! That was honestly the end of the episode. It's truly worse than any Days of our Lives episode. If I were the producers of GOT I would demand they stop selling this piece of crap as a prequel. HBO should refund everyone single dollar of subscription fees this month."
I will give 4 stars for now because t am trying to watch it from the day it was aired but i fall asleep after 10-15 minutes. And keep in mind that i'm a hardcore fan of GOT.
"This doesn't feel like a pilot episode, more like a mid season filler.Half the music including the very first notes we hear and the last are actual scores from GOT, which are clearly bait. The end scene also calls out to GOT when it's simply not needed, another bait.The sex and violence seemed unnecessary and misplaced. Half the episode is about the tourney.Matt Smith takes me out of the world by having such a familiar face, though his arrogant acting successfully makes you hate Daemon Targaryen from the first.The CGI is a bit much, including the colour palette. Feels like an early 2000s film.I've read the book this story is from, and for those who haven't, if the show becomes as exciting as the story then do watch it, but I feel like the conquest of the seven kingdoms and the arrival of the Targaryens in Westeros would have been way more exciting."
"Just the facts, ma'am. That's the impression you get from watching this. It's like reading a history book - not a very well written one at that. There are absolutely no characters you can warm up to. King Viserys comes the closest to someone you can sympathize with but of course you know what happens there. OMG, if only we could have the wonderful characters like Tyrion, Varys, Brienne, Jaime (in later episodes), Jon Snow, the northerners. I could go on and on. It was not the ""story"" that made GoT great - it was the characters. There are too many to name. You can love them, hate them, giggle at their interactions (give me just one scene between Tyrion and Varys). This second-rate knockoff is like ZOOMING through the facts and events and you don't care about even one of the characters at all. Not. One. I assume this series will continue so please tell the show runners to breathe some life into this very dry, unmoving, not very interesting story."
"The only character I began to like after the fifth episode was then suddenly aged 15 years forward and turned into another actor. It's hard to even see one good thing about this show now . With Game of Thrones as a precedent how have They managed to lose everything good that that had ?Not sure I can even watch another episode of this now it's too painful !Wow so I need to leave a longer review, 200 more words. Considering this series is quite dull it's a bit of a pain to leave a longer review, am I right ?? If you have watched the first couple of episodes and think it's average then I doubt it will get any better for you !"
The show runners explaining why each scene has meaning and portent is the most interesting part of the series. I can see this will disappointing. It is The Hobbit to the Lord of the Rings series. Sort of the same world. Sort of a connection to characters to come but derivative and shallow.And the white blonde black family might be a good waving of virtue but genetically unlikely. So much of the show seems to be muted as if the woke took Game of Thrones and decided except for horrific violence we will not do what that other naughty show did.Like I said if not for the show runners commentary afterwards I would not see or understand most of the show points. That's bad storytelling.
"I was really looking forward to this series because I really enjoyed Game of Thrones. However, the lighting in this series is horrible. In most scenes, it is impossible to see who is cheating on who and with who. My husband and I spent more time trying to figure out what was going on, that we lost the story line. Occasionally they show the characters in the light doing things, but then it is back to no lights. It became impossible to follow the storyline when you can't see the people in the story. I've read that the darkness is part of the storyline, but they have gone way too far - when you can't tell who is who."
"I will keep watching, but I've found it difficult to get invested in this series. Too many blonde wigs, which look especially ridiculous on the black characters, and too many people named Aegon. The casting change didn't help. I can't believe they couldn't have found actresses who could have played the role of both younger and older characters, given that they had only aged a few years.I've also found it hard to care who wins the rivalry over the Iron Throne. Did they add even more swords to it? Seemed ridiculous in the last episode. There isn't much else at stake, unless the Crab People somehow get more interesting.In the original, there was the whole ""winter is coming""/Whitewalkers/threat from beyond The Wall. Nothing like that here. Nor do I care which children ascend to positions of power. I guess I should be grateful that the blonde wigs help me remember who is legitimate and who is illegitimate (black hair).I'm hoping something happens that makes me want to change this review."
"Yet another show on your face showing how the woman had difficult time in the past, but nevertheless she is princess, who had much better things in life than some guy living in the streets down there.If the show had some story like GoT, where I was really cheering for daenerys targaryen before the S8, I would have loved it.But the whole show had no story and just how girls were married away for kingdoms.They should add some story lines. The first episode of GoT was much better than the 4 episodes of this series. Dragons are no more fun. They are like cats, everywhere now and some reason, the dragons are only limited to 3. Not sure why. I mean, they should have 10 or more 100 dragons."
"This is based on source material that needs a lot of dramatization written for it so it would work as an interesting live act and so far (2 episodes in) it doesn't seem like the writers know how or what to do to fill in those gaps with human interactions. That's why set pieces and characters are static, they talk to the audience exposition dumps not between themselves and there is very little meaningful dialogue. You can interpret this as subtlety but I think its just cluelessness on writers part. Also, contemporary political agendas even if not in your face are ruining characters, especially females by taking away their agencies as to prove some current day social point. It cheapens dramatic quality and them as characters. I didn't actually like GOT but if anything it did have characters with some complexity and a lot of them. So far in this show 2 episodes in and we know almost nothing about anyone except 2-3 people, way more narrow in world building through people and their perspectives. Judging by trailer for episode 3 I doubt this will change because its going into shallow season 7 territory with dragon fights. That's not why GOT became popular, there is no proper buildup to action to hook people in. So, this show will not have any comparable success to its predecessor. Just another forgettable action fantasy shlock."
"Anyone who thinks this is a great production hasn't been paying attention. The whole thing lacks fluidity and clarity. Most of the time I keep asking myself, why is this character doing this? With no apparent answer. Episode three made me feel like I missed one or two episodes. HBO, you made a big mistake making this. Viewers will not forget and even impact GRRM's releasing future productions of his works. Go back and look at any episode from season 1 of GOT. There are no questions as to why any of the events happen and those that first read the books, or not, are awed to see a truly ""professional"" TV show look as though they are watching a movie. Not here, the dialogue is as choppy as season 8 of GOT and the CGI is below par. Even the dragons look like something from a low budget horror movie.It would not surprise me if subscriptions drop due to this fiasco. Many were anxiously waiting to go back to Westros. But once they arrived they were severely disappointed to find it cheap and sloppy.We found out the hard way that not all directors make good writers.I hope Kit Harrington's project of Snow will be better."
"Are people simply giving this show good ratings because they are being told it is good?The story is boring and unengaging and there are no likeable characters. In fact, there is not much to like about it at all.There is no Hound, no Aria, no Cersei, no Red witch, no Dire wolves, or even a raven. I think you see where I'm going here. But wait... There ARE dragons. Is that the reason for all the hype and good ratings??I just fail to see why people are liking this show. I was never expecting it to be as good at GOT but I was hoping it would be close.I gave this show a rating of 1 to try to offset all the ludicrous 10s. Realistically, its maybe a 7 if you are into dramatic TV series.I've stopped watching it."
"The cinematography is great, and the special effects are great! The show looks great BUT, there is a HUGE BUT"
"1. Script is total nonsense and extremely cheap. Many events and actions make ZERO sense. This totally ruins the whole experience.2. The act of the main characters is bad and actors are not fit for their roles. The king looks like a tramp. Young princess doesn't look or act like a princess either. Her older version is a bit better, still not fit for that role.3. Director should have seen all that nonsense and fixed it.Overall it's like someone aquired the Game of thrones crew, hired poor actors and asked his cousin to write some nonsense script and created a total junk with great effects and scenes.Really disappointing. I don't understand the high ratings - this is like soap opera - nothing in it makes any sense."
"Seriously this series started out really good in my opinion which is why I originally gave it a 10.I was really upset when they chose two swap out the two main characters ""Queen"", and ""Princess"". I mean they didn't change out other characters so why them?I think that since its obvious that sexual preference is so important to everyone that there should be options for different gender groups to buy, rent, watch the versions of things that best fit their needs, desires, and taste instead of making us all watch it. What people do in their free time alone is their business & honestly as long as I am not made aware of it I could care less as that is between you & your maker. So instead of making straight scenes, gay scenes, etc why not make the series or movies in those different preference so that everyone can equity enjoy what ever it is that they want to watch & no one is mad, upset or offended. In the long run the movie & TV companies would make more money because they would sell to more people being they would be offending less people in the process & making more happy. Just a thought & for me personally I would be happy to see no sex scenes period you know like in the good old days when there were tons of great movies but not a sex scene every 10-15 minutes? If I want to watch porn, I will Google it!Another thing that made me like this series less is the insect. I feel like as a human race instead of moving forward we are moving backwards here. We are starting to allow & except things we would have never allowed before like under age sex, incest & so much more filthy mess. A lot complain but none or little do anything to change it!I really wish that Game of Thrones had continued although it had its moments as well in my opinion it was 100 times better then this series could ever hope to be.I have high hopes something will change in this series to keep me interested because I want to be but seams like there is just so much negative content that pushes me away instead."
"It just doesn't have the spark, the humor, or the great acting that made the original so awesome and groundbreaking. Lots of moody stares, long winded dialogue and an occasional gory or explicitly sexual scene to break up the monotony. And what's with the fascination with incest? Where is Peter Dinklage when you need him? The first series had a great many shocking moments, but there was just enough warmth and humor to make you care about the characters and what happens to them. No such luck here. And why drag on the poor king's suffering over several episodes? It added nothing to the story. I really expected more."
"As of episode three I hate it! Nothing interesting, don't love any of the characters, so far it's a father fighting with his teenage daughter. I put on the GoT first episode and the first 10 mins had grabbed my attention more than all three episodes. Don't believe me try it & you'll agree. I'm hoping it's gets better but at this pace it will probably won't get there until season 3. I'd rather watch GoT over than be bored of HotD anyday...................,..................................................................................................................................................................................................."
"I have been so excited to watch House of the Dragon, GOT is probably the best show ever made... at least the beginning seasons. Maybe I'm just getting soft in my old age, but this show is foul and vile, with little of the redeeming qualities or beloved characters. There is so little character depth and a lack of variety in the storylines. It's so sad because the visuals and costume design are excellent. I can tolerate some of the gore but it's almost as though they're pushing the boundaries just to do so. I've previously sworn off the series after prior two episodes, was outright bored until the scene where rhaenyra swoops in on her dragon, and got a hint of the excitement and goosebumps like there was in fact going to be something worth watching. But the last couple of episodes that have followed have been so barbaric and in your face disgusting, I thought tonight I'd give it one more go and was disgusted. You can still produce an excellent show without brothel orgies, constant incest and heads being bashed in like a melon... but for now that's all they've got so I'm throwing in the towel on this one."
"I just read the top review and my jaw dropped in disgust.The episode was rushed pure and simple.The dragons look so fake their laughable, they looked better in GOT.The music is too similar, and the end so is exactly the same as GOT.The director and writers needn't bother with a season 2 if their going to go ahead.The fighting scene with the prince after his failed jousting match was pathetic, the guy who defeated him should never have given him a chance to yield.The scene with the queen who was pregnant was disgusting what were they thinking.So much hype for nothing..what a waste."
"Currently there are only 3 episodes of ""House of the Dragon"", but there's been a lot of hype, and as a GoT fan, I jumped at the opportunity to binge on it.So far, there's a lot of yakking about the same thing: a girl being heir to the throne. Nothing else happening.Gorgeous costumes, decor, locations, but the plot is too simplistic (king having a daughter, rather than a son, succeeding him). The cast is not as good as the one in GoT either. Matt Smith is unpleasant, as required by the role, but also annoying to boot. The rest are forgettable.I found myself laughing out loud watching Paddy Considine swinging his arms awkwardly while giving the speech that started the tournament in episode 1."
"My Review of the first and second episode - First off, there's not nearly enough nudity or sex to call it ""gratitutious"" like all the reviews say. Did they even WATCH the first series? On that note, I could have gone without seeing the Eleventh Doctor's butt though. There are cool things about this series - Matt Smith (the aforementioned Doctor) is great in his role and he really captures the screen... any scene with the Dragons... locations from GoT (this is 170ish years before)... numerous easter eggs... a King who isn't deranged or evil.The Bad - The King is still an idiot. Most people are just...bad. It is woke, but it's only thrown it in your face a little bit, for instance, the two young teen girls are portrayed as the smartest, wisest, worldliest characters, even over all the knights, general, maesters, etc. And the only ones who can take action and be successful. The Princess is so smug, either something is wrong with her teeth and upper lip or she needs to be seriously smacked around...with a hammer. She is the one character I dislike. Black Targarians with silver hair just look dumb and fake and the rainbow representation of all these peoples mixed together, breaks the immersion because people do not naturally mix like that and never have, especially in medieval periods when travel and communication were not like they are today.The FX is decent, we ALREADY know how the stories ends, so the only other reason to tune in is to watch the train wreck and see the boobs, sex and gory violence. But, sometimes the last 3 are enough."
"I wasn't going to chance watching 'House of the Dragon' after the butchered ending that 'Game of Thrones' left us with, but there was nothing else available. I gave it a chance. The most obvious thing I noticed with 'House of the Dragon' is the lower budget. The first episode seemed like fan-fiction rather than a showcase for seasoned writers and diverse characters. The dialogue and conversations were bland and uninteresting for me. I had hoped for at least a single sex scene to grab my attention, but the writers felt that politics should be the sequence that holds this show together. The focus of episode one was purely set on kingly politics that will no doubt unravel and bring about the ruin of the kingdom. It isn't a little subtle about it, you can see it coming a mile away. The players have all thrown their cards on the table and you already know how the remaining season will play out. As anyone that enjoys political drama may contest it is unusual to find it in a fantasy story with dragons and princesses. It utterly bored me with the arrangement. This slightly necessary element created to further the plot was overdone, and it lagged on character development. I could care less about these people, and I'm already being told that I should be choosing sides or picking my favorites, but alas after an hour I know nothing about them. I can't even recall a single name of one of the characters. My fear is that this show will be the opposite of 'Game of Thrones' and become completely predictable. I will catch more episodes and update this post if needed, but as of right now I'm disinterested in what they've offered. It desperately needs the old tale's dramatic flair."
Have to agree with some reviews that I honestly don't get high ratings for this recent season within the GoT universe.House of Dragon is not a storytelling taking the viewers by the hand and leading them into the details of the pre-story.Another irritating fact comes with the changing of actors midway.Too long
Weak characters
No real storyline
Wrong casting
Sitcom style in ancient buildings
Lacking real action
Missed opportunity
Hopefully second season will be betterIn a nutshell: surfing of the global success of the GoT is not making this a A MUST WATCH season.2/10 and I tried to stay positive.
"Sadly that pretty much sums up the ""storyline"" of House Of The Dragon. I have never been particularly interested in watching so called ""noble"" families squabbling over power and now I remember why, its rather dull. GOT had multiple storylines running parallel, this show has only the 1.Game Of Thrones had a its fair share of noble squabbles its fair to say but it also had the overall menace from the White Walkers returning from the North while the seven kingdoms was engaging in its usual petty squabbles over who was in charge. They failed to see the great menace approaching ( not so great after all ) and continued to fight amongst themselves.Also the time jumps makes it very hard to get attached to many of the characters and the actors playing them as they are quickly replaced after a handful of episodes by an older version. For example I loved the actress playing the young Rhaenyra, yet she was gone mid season and the attachment I had developed for the character went with her. Anyway its no GOT to be sure but many will sing its praises simply because its set in the same universe."
"I understand that it takes time to set the scene, however, we already know the lore of Westeros. There's no reason for this show to be so slow. I found myself bored throughout the first 3 episodes. I'm a fan of GOT (minus the last season of course) but there has been no excitement shown this far. I'm sure the writers felt that a lot of original fans of GOT would watch, and they aren't wrong, but after three episodes there should be at least one reason for me to continue watching. At this point, I will give the show another episode or two to pick up the pace, but if it doesn't, I don't see myself being a dedicated fan of this show."
"I deleted my first review, because I wrote it only after 2 episodes. I thought I give it more time hoping it is not as bad as it looked.The last screens of episode 7 show why this is just a melodrama with bad plots. Without spoilers: it turns an otherwise dramatic event into a soap opera. We can be sure that nothing bad will happen, everybody is good after all. All the fighting can be solved with a little discussion or some easy deception. Even the most evil characters show mercy. Well, actually, there are no evil characters.We are very far from the tragedies of GoT.This is pathetic. This is GoT porn. Yes, it is beautiful, it looks fantastic, they put enough money, time and knowledge into this production. It is an empty shell however.The most annoying thing is that George R. R. Martin is involved in the making. Should I think he has run ouf of inspiration?"
"This feels like the Star Trek Discovery equivalent of TNG. It is so incredibly dull, it took me ages to get through it, the forceful placement of actors in the quest of 'diversity' is just painful to see every scene. Why stop at making Targaryen's black, let's make the wildlings Chinese and Dorne Indian? It just feels so fake and forced. I do not like any one of the characters, I have no one to root for. I enjoyed Game of Thrones right from the onset, so many places, locations, plot lines, characters, I rewatched it so many times. This is just a painful high school drama with annoying shallow characters. The best part about it is the intro..."
"It's starts slow bit gets better until episode 6, then it looks like someone stole the money from their budget and everyone stopped caring. Biggest load of trash ever. They should be utterly ashamed of themselves for this whole situation. It could have been good, that is the problem, but it was so infuriating that it hurt me fiscally, I want reparations. How this is allowed is beyond me and more than heads must roll. I feel ill and disgusted. If ever I thought that I must give Netflix another try, this confirmed it. My TVs are now paperweights, and I will sell them all.Not even worth downloading for free. You will get your hopes up and get it trampled under inexperienced fools. Sick. DONE with TV, done with movies. Just go bankrupt already."
"The first 3 episodes were barely watchable, but sadly the latest episode was all talk, and zero action, other than a sex scene.I had to FF all of it as there was zero action. A dragon flew overhead at one stage and I guess to the writers that was enough?!Four episodes and it's nothing but a slow and boooooring soap opera with some soft porn, the traditional GOT-violence and a moronic dialogue.Everything that was so great with the original GOT is totally lost here. No strong villains, no strong heroes, no mystery and nothing interesting that takes the story forward.And the insane total rating (8,8!?) must come from die hard GOT-fans who have not watched this nonsense at all."
"HBO had such a hit with Game of Thrones, how can they follow it up with this sleepy, mid evil soap opera? No strong characters, no mystery plots, nothing exciting about this show at all.Come HOB you have a chance for another winner here and you are blowing it, big time.Where is the drama? Where are the evil characters? Matt Smith improperly cast in his role! The young lady playing the princess, is not believable! I could go on & on but what is the point, the show is a dud, beyond repair.Not sure how or if HBO can resurrect this, likely too late. So, don't waste your time hoping for a GOT sequel, it's nit here."
I think HOTD is set too far away from GOT timeline. No one want to see great great great grandfather of daenerys Targaryen. 200 years back from GOT means great number of fans would never see Prince Rhaeghar nor Sir Athur Dayne in flesh and we waited years for nothing. So dissapointed with director that been given this valuable contract of this great franchise and wasted it all. Im one for sure will not continue to watch HOTD. BIG LETDOWN.
"Have you ever lost interest of a movie/series because you found actors / actress who absolutely not likable because of how they look like or because of lack of acting skills? Have you ever found these two things in one person?Yeah, that is Emma D'arcy aka Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen"
"I'm sorry, really...just I can't watch her fish-blooded acting, she has absolutely no facial expression and ...everyone met in their lives with a few people who has a type of face just cause inconviniently bad vibe...?"
"I'm sticking with this despite the weak script, slow moving storyline and a lack of any gripping thread. The cast is a lot weaker than GOT and it shows, none of the characters are strong enough for one to really care about and overall I would describe it as bland. I get the feeling that someone thought they could feed off of the success of GOT but somehow the whole project got lost and judging by other reviews itvhas only achieved minority appeal. Ghe dragons, despite ghe title, hardly feature so far with only the odd appearance. There are not enough battles or any action sequences compared to GOT. Overall a really disappointing series."
"Really, the cost of each episode is 20 million dollars.it is so boring. The story is so flat with a cliche idea. The directors were trying to use the metaphor of the dark scene to show the dark age. But they went far beyond that almost nothing is visible. For obvious points, directors spend a lot of time, and for complicated points, they did so quickly. The story jumped for ten years without proper explanation. Some of the nudity scenes are at the level of porn and there was no reason for such nudity. The rating of this product only proves that today's TV productions reduce the minimum good taste of TV series."
"Seriously guys you cut off the Young Rhaenyra and come out with the adult one moaning from the birth?? At first I tought that whose this girl until alicent called her name its truly a wrong move and make the story lack of foundations and the adult Rhaenyra just a plain girl without any ambition and strong figure like the young one which more firey and truly resemble the dragon figures. The timeline gap very worse did you only wish it only have 2 seasons? If so well, it's answer everything about the gap and lack of history to tell And strong character except for Daemon which absent most of the times. A disappointment indeed the adult character just boring and plain as a snow being step by the white walkers."
"To start, I am a huge fan of GoT. I have watched the series many times over and love it (minus the last season, but I don't know anybody who liked the last season).I had high hopes for this series. With a virtually unlimited budget, I expected it to blow me away. To start with the positives, the sets and wardrobes are out of this world. They definitely went all out in these two areas. The acting is fairly well done. While there is certainly room for improvement in some areas of acting, for the most part it was great. Now for the negatives... The absolute worst part of this show is the writing. You can have the best sets, acting, and wardrobes in the world, but if you have a poor script then there is no hope for the show. That is where this show fails. The first few episodes are very exciting, full of action and traditional GoT violence, sex, and gore. Then when you get to episode five - otherwise known as the ""dread wedding"" - things just take a massive turn. The story slows down to a crawl and turns from action to soap opera. Episode six comes along and all of a sudden we have jumped forward twenty or so years without any notice. Ten minutes in to the episode you are wondering ""who are these people?"" When you finally realize who everybody is, you are left with nothing but questions. The main one is: how is it that the king was shown dead at the end of episode five but now he is alive and well running the kingdom?This show leaves no time for character development before jumping ahead, and leaves you not caring about the ""new characters"" at all. It ends up being a beautiful, but ultimately hollow, series."
"The GOT producers continue their streak. Just like the last few seasons of GOT, any scene set at night or inside a castle is so wildly underlit, you literally cannot see what is happening. They seem to have forgotten that while they have the script in front of them, the audience doesn't. Or maybe they think they are making a 10 hour film to be shown in a theater in complete darkness and laser projection? But they're not. They are making a TV show to be watched at home.Either that, or they just don't care what their audience thinks or wants (see the ending of GOT). If we can't see what's going on why should we watch?"
"There's almost nothing to like about Hot D. No joy, no laughter, no hope. I watch and probably will watch every episode of this completely devoid of positive emotion. None of the characters are likeable. There's no underlying mystery or intrigue. No reason to watch the next episode except for the fact that it exists to be watched. It's incredibly boring and incredibly disappointing. They even used the same music from Game of Thrones.But the production value is through the roof, the actors are extraordinary, and the dragons look fantastic. I will watch because of these factors, and HBO will think they did a great job, and they will make more of this depressing fantasy."
I'm sure it will get better but I found this episode slow and hard to follow. I also don't particularly like any of the lead characters. However its laughable there are people coming on here and complaining that they cast some black people because it's not realistic. There are giant flying dragons in the show. If you are ok with that you should be ok with some black characters.
"Postmodern treatment of the scenario that mixes 2020 modern parental concerns and medieval behaviour makes no sense, you can see parents spending times with children like we do nowadays after school. They check on their home work, please give a kiss to dad and mum before going to bed, brush thier teeth...I was waiting for the Queen to summon her kids to stop spending time behind a screen because social networks were bad for their mental health. Moreover the willingness to be seen as a post metoo scenario is so obvious and unrealistic that makes the plot totally dull. Over all it is quite boring and predictible. GOT got fare more GUTS !"
"Casting is lacking something. Costume choices are strange, wigs for everyone. Story feels forced, and scattered.It starts to build up to something and then decides to be a soap opera instead.Where's the character integrity? The princess goes from a strong principled dragon riding woman not wanting husband to practically shagging her uncle in public. Then shes railing a knight just cause she wanted to. It has soap opera vibes all over, and that just the first few episodes.The original Game of Thrones struggled a bit in the beginning as it introduced everyone. Hopefully this one is the same, and gets better fast because so far it isn't good enough to be called Game of Thrones."
"Like so many people, I had high hopes for this show based on the multi-dimensional successes of GOT. Imagine my disappointment after committing to six episodes of some of the most boring, detached TV I've ever seen. The entire thing feels like a contradiction - somehow the writers have managed to rush the season while simultaneously failing to generate any interest whatsoever. It's Game Of Thrones with neither intrigue nor action. I'm left feeling nothing for the characters and thus, disconnected from the plot altogether, and I wager that if it weren't for reputation of this show's predecessor, House of The Dragon would be sitting at a dwindling 5 stars on IMDb. It certainly doesn't deserve the 8+ rating that it currently holds..."
"Until the 5th episode, the action was developing quite well, although the chaotic style of editing and construction of the plot and characters increasingly interfered with the reception. The 6th episode killed the whole series with its form, and the replacement of some of the actors, .... leaving almost unchanged Sir Croston Cole (which happens very rarely in series generally) has already discouraged me from watching this title permanently. All the time I tried to fight with myself not to turn it off while watching.... but unfortunately it didn't work, and thus a promising series falls off the list of watched potential hits. It's a shame. Overall, I recommend watching and see if, in an era of dozens of great titles released monthly, it's not worth taking care of the viewer? The creators of House of the Dragon failed to do so, unfortunately :("
"I absolutely loved Game of Thrones, though I admit the first season was a little slow moving. However, at least it had interesting characters and well written dialogue, and the action sequences we did get were well done.House of the Dragon is sooooooo boring, and there is not one interesting character thus far. This isn't as bad as that crappy lord of the rings spinoff on Prime, but it sure is close. I'm 8 episodes in and basically nothing has happened, just a lot of rambling dialogue and some minor political scuffling. I hope season two will be a lot better, although based on what I have seen, a second season isn't warranted. Super disappointed and I wasn't expecting it to be all that great to begin with."
"The show is simply just boring and there are no events to care about. All the interesting dialogues and scheming are gone and every discussion is just characters being incredibly dumb or snappy. Except the king who is pretty much the only interesting character. Other ones you just dont care about even though they should be the main ones. Even when someone is at danger or someone dies, you just dont have that same connection to them as you did in GOT.The absence of meaningul and interesting events are then filled up with gory prolonged scenes (birth scenes), sensless fight scenes or then just showing some dragons for a while to give the audiences even something.Overall, I would say that the whole series could have easily been able to fit inside 4-5 episodes. But more episodes and more money I guess.. Last season for me though."
"Much simpler than GoT.First few episodes are somewhat interesting, you start to pick your favorite characters, a few of them show some good qualities. Then after about episode 6 it all goes downhill.The story:"
"a bunch of depraved individuals kill or copulate with each other in order to be the next in line in the king's succession. Nothing else matters, nothing else is shown. Not a word on economy, philosophy, technology, social issues, context.The setting:"
"early medieval kind of society, some magic (dragons), knights, lords, sword fighting, dark castles.The show is so monothematic that it's boring. Everybody is trying to be the next king/queen or be in their good graces. No context, no particular motivations for the characters. Even the current king himself doesn't look too happy or powerful or like he has accomplished anything of value other than just being the king. Hardly in a position to envy. Why then is everybody trying to be next?The writers cater to those who like to see grotesque scenes, depravity, gore. I am not one of them. It is one thing to shock audiences every now and then to spice up the story but in this case the grotesque is the main dish. I find that very distasteful.By the end of episode 8 there was nobody left for me to root for. I couldn't care less about who gets to be the next king/queen or even about who survives. The dragons could burn everybody up for all I cared."
"Im shocked how bad this was. Disband this piece of garbage show. The acting, Cgi, story all bad. The original was shot in real locations this studio cgi mush is just heartbreaking to watch."
"Gratuitous sex and violence abound. No compelling characters. Iffy CGI. If the original Game of Thrones rates a 10, this is certainly a 6. I will watch the second episode, but if the low quality of the pilot continues, I won't watch any more. It is very difficult to make a prequel or sequel to an outstanding original concept. So far, the producers and directors have failed here. I sincerely hope George R. R. Martin isn't involved. This breech birth isn't worthy of his talents. UPDATE: After watching episodes 2 and 3, I dropped my rating from 6 to 3. Acting is poor, dialog is forced, violence is gratuitous, and the characters are shallow and unmemorable. I won't waste any more time on this turkey."
"The original series still to this day has left a horrible...horrible taste in my mouth. So much promise with the first 5 or so seasons squandered away with bad writing, putting an emphasis on special effects and political points of view instead of dialogue and acting . The first season of GOT was fantastic. Instead of keeping with a great story the producers went the Marvel Route with all show and no substance. That's my rant . So anyway let me get to this series. This series even after EP 1, which should draw u in has done everything but . It has no substance, no heart, & really not much of anything there's no build up of the characters. The first episode offers nothing in the form of a good story. The characters have no depth. It's like there just there going threw the motions. The viewer doesn't know any of these characters nor does the viewer give a crap. There's just NO interest . No caring . The viewer needs to care , needs to be invested. The first episode offered nothing ."
"Before all you 10s hate on my 1 understand, it's my opinion not yours. Some love this episode and some may hate it. I simply didn't like it. And if your interested, here's why. There is so much dialog that should have been left out.By not telling us, it forces us to imagine WHY. Don't explain all about the brother. Him sitting on the throw says so much. Explaining it destroys the story.Every character narrates their intentions or desires.When the cupbearer walks in late, do not explain the situating. Let her rush in hastily to fill the cups. First with the King's, whom covers his and gives her a sideways disappointed look. She stops in her tracks and stairs down at her feet, holding the pitcher motionless. He allows her to stand there as he finishes his council meeting. Then asks them all to leave.After the last man has left and the sound of the door closes. He counsels her about her duties and responsibilities. She acknowledges her error, but questions the need for a cupbearer ""men of shut power and wealth should not have such week wrists."" He laughs and catches the whiff of her dragon. He says nothing and she departs.We see his Saturn but fair. Powerful but a father. She is obedient but not week. She can play the came but on her terms.Do NOT actually explain the dragon smell on her AGAIN.The dialog feels too much like real House Wives and less like GoT. But it is an easy fix. Show. Don't tell. ."
"Where game of thrones weaves 12 different plots with interesting characters and amazing storylines, House of Dragons follows one. Boring story.Every character is more annoying than the last.I only watch, while reading or doing something else just to see if any of these annoying characters get killed.So far, no big surprise deaths like when the father got decapitated by joffrey in the first season (or book) in game of thrones.Watch if you must but it's an incredibly bad show that will frustrate the heck out you.The only good thing about House of Dragons is that they kept the Game of thrones theme song."
"The politics are silly, there is no character building whatsoever, no mystery, no sense of humor and the dialogues will bore you into a slumber.Combine that with poor acting, pathetic special/computational effects and a general darkness to cover the general poor quality of it all.Without comparing it to Martin's books or the previous series, this is absolutely unwatchable.Worse than the last seasons of GoT. The complete opposite of Martin's original material.Being a fan of the genre I can stand a mediocre product if it is at least entertaining. This is not. It is just a failed attempt to keep milking the GoT cow."
"A poorly written and failed attempt trying prove they can be like GOT yet do it better. 2nd episode in and I can not connect with any character and I am still waiting for something, anything really, to actually happen.I could find more excitement from Grand Maester Pycelle coughing through the lineage of House Frey than I do at any point in this series. Shame on the directors, HBO, whoever allowed this pathetic excuse of a show to be aired. You wasted our time, money, and the one opportunity we all had to immerse ourselves once again into the world of Game Of Thrones.As much as I absolutely hated how tv GOT ended, at least it was exciting, immersive, and a great story, albeit in a horrible direction unlike the House Of The Dragon has been so far. Its just more and more talking with no emotion, everybody seems week and hesitant to speak up. How TF did they get into such a high position at court acting like spineless, chinless Freys all the time. I mean come on!"
"Milly Alcock as the Princess, Matt Smith and Rhys Ifans are the only actors present of interest to me. That's a terrible showing for such a large production with a huge cast. To make it worse, Milly Alcock has finished her role this week in episode 5 so where we go from here is a problem. The young actress who plays the Queen is hopelessly miscast with zero presence but she's gone too now. Paddy Considine, a normally good actor is all wrong for the King also, looks weak and feeble here. Diverse casting too is so boring just for the sake of it, no interesting actors. I've seen five episides and will carry on in the hope it gets better but I'm not"
optimistic any more. Pretty much a disaster.
"So far, House of the Dragon is mediocre at best. Casting feels way off the mark across the board, audio mixing is strange and imbalanced, CGI is last-gen and embarrassing, and there wasn't a single compelling or likeable character... except maybe the one who died half way through Ep 1?You won't find Game of Thrones level artwork or storytelling here. This is AAA ball branded to make you hope it's the big leagues, but it's not remotely close. I hope the series improves in time, and it may, but the pilot was exceedingly underwhelming.Oh and the makeup, hair, costumes, and sets are well below the GoT standard. Years have passed and yet they create something... worse?"
"A bad dress with some funny House Targaryen wigs, apart from being blonde, the actor's beard is half black, it doesn't even stick with glue. They are doing well and you are laughing at how badly they have done. A casting that is not very good, they want to reduce costs and by taking on new and cheap people and in the end it shows in the interpretation. The plot that broja, does not attract much attention, but it is much appreciated that the saga continues since it costs a lot to make series like this, and more is needed, since fantasy and science fiction give a lot of theme and also many joys when there is a good script behind."
"This was the worst director I have ever seen for anything. Really, this was the best director you could have gotten for a first episode of this scale. This guy should never be a director of anything ever. How horrible, you have this good of material and budget and you blew it this badly. I certainly hope the rest of the series is not directed by this clown."
"Unbelievably boring. Just a Middle Ages jousting tournament which seemed to make up half the episode, boring actors with no chemistry, and extremely tedious royal court politics.Oh and thrown in a few dragons just to remind the audience, that , yes you really are watching Game of Thrones?Mind you I really loved Game of Thrones, but that had great actors ( nearly everyone in it was brilliant, ) whereas this pathetic offering has terrible actors.Then it had great plot and story, whereas this is just recycled boring Middle ages England pageantry and house politics.No sorry, this is a total misfire in every way."
"Nowhere near as enthralling or entertaining as GoT. So far, it's a mish-mash of ""how many familiar GoT names can we toss out,"" battling against ""how many families and characters can we throw at viewers, and let's not forget to do it at breakneck speed."" Good lord, I don't watch TV with a notepad at hand so that I can take notes on who is who, or to sketch out family trees.Add to that, half the characters are children so the actors playing them change every few episodes as the characters age.Things finally got rolling partway through Ep8, but by that time I'd mostly lost interest.All in all, I'd give HoD a solid 'meh'"
Granted its only one episode in but it was nothing special. Maybe expectations are high but i was a bit disappointed. I really hope it picks up as its predecessor was awesome.
"None of the characters are likeable, not even the children. The show is all over the place. Too many loose ends, I will not be watching next season. I was very disappointed with the whole season. It seems like they made the show to shock and nothing else. The grotesque king, the music, costumes, the drama.... nothing.. chaotic. There was no character worth bonding with, everyone is selfish and entitled. This show was a mess. I liked every season of the game of thrones, except the last but I was still a fan. This first season of this show feels like they just added drama and gross characters (attitude, personalities and afflictions) and just threw in silliness. The main character is one of the worst, she's not likeable but they want you to like her for some reason. Just a bunch of sociopaths being their entitled selves and I can't do another season. Sorry."
"Honestly, i don't trust the ratings on this site anymore. If the people who watched and loved GoT is the same people who rated HotD, i can definitely not trust the high rating this show have.As many others already have said; this is a soap opera that completely pales in comparison with Game of Thrones.GoT - until it was butchered - was an epic with complex and intriguing story and characters. This show is clearly written by people who's only capable of writing one-dimensional stories and characters, similar to every other mediocre tv show.There's not one single likable character that you love to love or love to hate. Nobody to root for or against. Not one to actually invest in and care for. They all have cardboard personalities.While GoT was juggling the focus on a plethora of interesting characters and houses with a lot of brewing intrigues and forthcoming threats, HotD is pretty much just focusing on one character and one house and a bunch of gossip and backstabbing, worthy of a high-school drama. On a positive note; you won't need maps and family trees to follow this show. It's as complex as an episode of ""Blossom."""
"For context, I enjoyed Dexter new blood and the Entourage movie - when I like a series or a character, I'm invested, it takes a lot to let me down, even with low expectations.This drivel was awful in every way. Totally uninspiring, really boring and an emphatic failure. GOT has infinite legs, they could have gone anywhere with it and they messed it up. Shame on everyone involved. Why was Paddy Considine so meek in this? Bring back the Dead Man's shoes intensity man.Absolutely woeful. Only got to the end of episode two and was rigid with boredom. I read a review that said rewatch GOT. That's what I will do and everyone else should - this prequel was pointless."
"Iv watchet first and second episode . I can tell for shure this is not even near to GOT succses.First i dont like single cast member they all are how to put it ,not likeble not becose of the charcter they play its lack of harizma and meybe bad acting . Plus for 2 episode that is up now i dont have favorite charcter just becose show dosent make me feel to have one .In GOT i isntantly liked most of the Starks and i got ppl who i dont like becose show make you care for certen ppl , this is coused becose in got we have verry good writen story and its detailed , here i dont feel even the story ... its like medievel soup tv seres...."
"I hope its just bad/slow start and in next episode will get better ,but i doubt it becose the show its not good here actors are bad choise for me personaly and lack of good acting is killing the vibe....."
"Despite having only seen the first two episodes of House of the Dragon, I think it's already safe to say that this series is not going to live up to it's hype. This series is just NOT on the same level as it's predecessor. It's been more than 10 years since the first season of GoT aired on HBO, and watching the first episode of HotD feels like we've gone back in time. Of course, storywise we're set back about 172 years in Targaryen family history, but what I mean is productionwise. Compared to GoT, the whole look and feel of HotD is a complete downgrade. From the costumes, the characters, the attention to detail, to the overall use of CGI, it's just never on the same level as GoT. In a show that focuses mainly on the 'house of Dragons' you would expect these dragons to look absolutely flawless, like Drogon in GoT. They don't. They look like what you would expect from a show on TV-show budget. GoT went way beyond that level. Another thing that bothered me was the lack of charisma or realism in the characters. With most of the Targaryens you can clearly see they're all wearing wigs. As for king Vyseris; he looks almost cartoonish, as if he just walked off some Disney-live action Fairytale movie set. Same goes for Daemon. His armor in the first episode during the joust game just looks ridiculous, with the flappy dragon wings on his helmet. Remember Jaimie Lannisters armor in GoT? Or even that of The Mountain? THAT is how you make an armor look realistic. These armors represented the persons wearing it. It showed their persona. Damon's armor is just a poorly designed, cartoonishly caricatural representation of a bad guy.I could go on about all the details that bothered me in this show, or the clearly forced sex scenes and brutal violence the first episode is packed with, but overall it's just clear that what we've got here is a show that desperately and forcefully tries to be as good as GoT, but just never reaches that level."
"I saved this up for a day when I had lots of ""inside"" jobs to do or took ill and was stuck looking for something to distract me. Lo and behold, I fall sick and thought to myself ""Oh, good time for House of the Dragon"".Let me start by saying that I think it contributed to the longevity of my illness and, in fact, may have worsend it!There were some glaring lapses of logic e.g. Dude brings news from the king to his brother that the king is sending supplies etc, which are in serious short supply, and bother responds by beating said dude with his helmet. Huh? Brother then runs off to single-handedly fight the baddies that they've had under siege for months. Double huh??It's all starting to drag so we throw in a scene in a ""pleasure house"" with a bit of nudity and a pash between brother blondie and daughter blonde (don't ask me their names coz the only name I remember is Jason but I couldn't tell you who Jason is or what part of the organ he plays).Then, somehow, brother blondie kills his wife. Once again, no idea why. Then Queen, who used to be daughter blondie's best mate starts machinations of her own. I didn't care who was doing what for why by this stage. Oh, and daughter blondie is betrothed to gay, black dude after ""launching her crack"" at her bodyguard... or something.I gave up."
Most boring thing I have ever seen on OTT. I watched 2 to 3 episode waiting for the story to pick pace but nothing. Only nudity and dragons are seems to be main effort put by directors.Ok fine it should not be compared with GOT. But where is the plot? Infact i do not have anything to write about but i have to complete six hundred words to post this review so now I am going to write a poem. Twinkle twinkle little star. How I wonder what you are. Of above the words so high. Like a diamond in the sky. Lol poem is also not enough to complete the words. Ok fone hod is boring. Plot is missing. Nudity and dragons are not enoungh to maintain interest.
"8 years of GOT plus 8 Seasons later and they did not change characters at all. Here we have HOD and 5 episodes in they change characters. And i stopped watching after ep6. Milly fit the character of the princess much better and she looks straight out of GOT. Well now, since i can't watch it anymore after HBO or the Producer or Director or whoever decided to change the character for whatever dumb reason and not thinking of what the viewers might think, i guess i'll go watch other shows. That's not to say i don't like it but i liked the first 5 episodes and i was really dissatisfied and upset to find out after a week of waiting for episode 6, they changed actors. That's a bummer, imagine them changing Olivia in GOT. Right, i didn't think so!!!"
"Why are we all okay with watching old men marry and father children with children? It just feels like kids having sex with adults is going to be a major theme in the show and it just makes the whole thing extremely uncomfortable. I don't care if that's how it was done way back when, this is fantasy and it's ruining the fantasy element for me. They had the choice to focus on something interesting, but instead we get doctor who being a teenager and a teenager assuming the role of an adult.I just don't get the fuss over this show....which is a shame because I love medieval fantasy.3/10 not for everyone..."
"I give a 4 for the actors, but really l watch this show with my wife because she loves it ( so she says )"
"We were so excited to watch GOT up until the disaster ending but the truth is this show is far to be as good as GOT was at its start.So far 6 episodes of nothingness, so l don't get it when l see that the rating is 8.4 ... l really don't !3 horrific birth in 6 episodes, seriously ?!?!We want action in between build up, fighting, surprises, twists, anticlimax, etc...Not grumpy lethargic dragon burning down cheap and pregnant women.Anyway l will be watching until my wife get bored of it, let's hope soon."
"Bad acting, no storyline, uninteresting characters, worst colour grading, unwanted gore and forced sex scenes, I would re watch the whole GOT seasons once again but not watching a single episode of this garbage again."
"This season of House of Dragon started off nice and smooth. Great introduction to a new era on GoT. Clearly this type of show is mainly enforced by its writing followed by performances. It feels like the writers got too zoned in and created chaos within the script by adding 18482 children, subtle issues and of course the dull and overused idea of fighting for the throne. Although it may serve as a necessity, these constant time jumps and actor changes leave audiences to retrack where the hell they are. Its completely messy writing (Aaron Sorkin wouldnt approve lol). Theres not one episode where i felt the need to watch the next episode besides outliving my boredom.GoT set the bar and HoD just can't hold its own. Thats a big NO to season 2 or recommending this to anyone."
"This was unbilievably poorly done. I could not get attached to any of the characters, and frankly the whole season was devoid of any action.There were more scenes of birthing then fighting (with the exception of prince Daemon fighting the Crab King).Because the show changed actors for the main characters, we were not able to get attached and storyline didn;t help.We were bored out of my mind, desperately looking for that one piece of narrative that would reel us in. It never happened.If one was to compare GOT S01 to this, there was so much more and better character development. We knew right away who was good, who was bad. With this one, I don;t even remember their names. It is not clear why some of the characters were part of the narrative at all ... anyway, we are deeply unimpressed."
"First they changed the queen midseason .. shes the only one bringing the show lol.. uninteresting.. no dragons .. more on family politics and feuding.. boring ... casting is so bad.. theres black people with silver hair.. how come they dont have that in the original lol.. woke tv series made by woke people lol.. hbo should fire the people who made this.. and the people who is rating this 8 ,9 and 10 are paid trolls.. dont believe on the 8.9 raring they are all paid obviously with the way they put the headers of their review... its so obvious hbo is putting money in their trolls.. tv series is boring and bad .. rings of power has much more dept and more interesting.."
"Like most I loved the original GOT series (season 8 not included) and had high hopes when this was announced that it could live up to the original at least to a degree however that has not come to pass.Firstly the cast is just all wrong, out of all the main cast I can barely think of one who is appropriately cast, the writing and character development feels rushed and at no point was I invested in any of the characters like I was with the original series.What the original did so well was get you invested, whether you loved or hated the characters there was investment in seeing how their story played out but here I just don't care either way and feel completely indifferent towards them all. On top of this there is the shoehorned diversity, interracial couplings and homosexuality which all feels very forced and essentially just feels like a tick box exercise for political correctness like a lot of other shows these days.I am really struggling to find anything positive to say about this, even the CGI was a let down and feels cheap and makes me wonder where the budget went on this one, the only good thing was that it made me want to rewatch the original again just to get the sour taste this left in my mouth.3/10 and that's being generous."
"I was nervous to see how this show went after the last season of GoT. Episode one... I was floored! Perfection. Just what the Dr needed for that itch. Then they changed times and the new main character actress... she has the personality of a rock. The younger version gave us her smile and ups and attitude and strength, after the time jump I'm surprised it's supposed to be the same woman?? Character has no development, no grief no excitement no attitude, and let's be real, why show the younger version of her if you turn her into a lump of bleached coal. Dameon is fabulous at first I was all Dr Who can't be evil but then again it's GoT so you are obviously falling in love with his badness.Give us a GoT adress we deserve for R and you would have saved the series. Myself and other livers of the throne series already are meh about if we want to keep up on the episodes now."
This show have really bad wig. Lord Corlys Velaryon is comical everytime i see him i.laugh how funny he look.This must be Game of thrones parody right ?
"I watch it because I like dragons, I bet like most people do... Now, when I started to like some characters for example princess Rhynnera, directors / owners / God knew who change cast? Plus Rhynnera start behave absolutely insane in 5 episode?What /who I can like it in the HOD series? I don't know. King Viserys start behave exactly like Baratheon in GOT. Drinking and poor decision making. His choice of queen is exactly like horror movie where we all knows that main character should not go alone in the dark and voila there we go... It's someone sane there? Hello?ARE THE CREATORS ASSUME THAT PEOPLE WHO BUILD EMPIRES ARE ON SUCH LEVEL OF STUPIDITY?Imagin yourself build empire with thousands allies and with support of the many and then you go crazy and changing course like 180 degrees in to clearly set up oblivion?I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. I BELIEVE THAT ALL SUCH DECISIONS ARE MADE ONLY TO MAKE DRAMA AND MAKE MONEY. THAT STORY AND WHOLE TV SHOW IS NOT FOR FANS!!! Sorry, not sorry...."
"After two first episodes I find House of the Dragon quite boring. In general the story is small in scale, it lacks the grip and lack drama, it has plenty of weak dialogues and rather badly elaborated details of sets. Matt Smith has been the only fascinating of all cast so far. Where are power plays and mind games, humour and jokes, witty dialogues, where are colourful characters we remember from the first series of Game of Thrones? Three stars and this all despite of sex scenes, lot of blood and lot of dragons, lol.P. S. Some actors have funny, obviously synthetic wigs which don't help to take everything seriously."
Started off ok but got slower and slower. Episodes could have easily been 10 minutes long but got drawn out for an hour. The whole season could have been done in an hour. Why can't people just get to the point when writing shows these days?Started off ok but got slower and slower. Episodes could have easily been 10 minutes long but got drawn out for an hour.

"I really loved GoT which had everything, including pace. In contrast House of Dragon is complete garbage, poor labouring storyline, underlayed with common gutter language associated with the worse chavs...unspeable violence and exploitative child birth tossed in for no other reason than to shock......the characters are forgettable, lack any humour or depth or warmth that one can relate too...."
"The people giving this high marks just don't have a clue about imagination, creativity and adventure...just going with the brain dead masses. Finally this is utterly woke, makes no sense....just avoid this rubbish and don't be sucked in by deluded plebs. God I miss Tyrion and Daenerys Targaryen and Bran....and off course dear old Knight King."
"Cheap, poor script, worse acting, less developed characters, lousy CGI. Barely possible to watch the entire first episode. Daemon's dragon helmet in painted plastic made it watch worthy though!Congratulations to HBO if this cow is still possible to milk another dollar or two."
"I'm trying so hard to like this, GOT is the best thing I have ever watched. The compelling stories in GOT were built slowly with simple dialogue. You would feel like you really knew the characters and chose a side.With House of the Dragon I'm made to feel stupid. Names are thrown around of people and places who matter or do not? I'm still not sure. Everything just feels overcomplicated yet nothing much seems to happen? Over the top dialogue and little substance. It looks great but I feel completely disconnected from the characters and their causes... to be Frank the story is boring as can be up to now. Praying it gets better."
"Let me state that this show will always be compared to GoT, and boy it lacks so much. Boring characters with no real wit, feels cheap with CGI all the time. Putting aside a few pictoresque shots, every moment feels like a greenscreen scene happening in a little enclosure with a few actors. Nothing grandiose, not ahowing the beauty of the city and all the time it feels empty - cheap.I will give it more time and watch the next episodes but if it goes on like this, I will abandon it altogether.I mean come on, If a show is good I am mesmerised almost instantly, 99%of the times it is love at first scene. And that spark didnt come when watching this.The only marginally interesting part is the intro ðŸ˜…"
"I was a fan of game of thrones and started to watch this one with high expectation but it totally disappointed me. There is hardly none action scenes. It is full of pair dialogues.if you like watching two people talking in a dark place, then you should certainly watch it. Episodes are easy to predict what is going to happen next. I was always comparing it with GOT maybe it was a fault to watch like this. Actors and actresses were replaced after a couple of episodes as years are passed in it. This was one of the silliest thing. As I mentioned with the title, the serious was full of dark scenes. Maybe it is because of lowering the cost of cgi! If you have nothing to watch , you can try it."
"We're getting the sets, the locations, the extras, the CGI and the overall production value we expected from the last 4 seasons from GoT. But just as the writing of those last four seasons left to be desired does this show fail in it's story telling. There is just no emotion in this first season. There are very view likeable characters to begin with, and when they kill off one of the few of that category, you had so little time with them before that you really couldn't care less. Take the death of Matt Smith's character's wife (see how little I cared, I don't even remember the name) - this could have been an emotional anchor in this season, but we knew so little about the character that her death didn't matter at all. Same with the supposed love between Rhaenyra and her uncle - there is ZERO chemistry between them and it just doesn't register - the incest doesn't matter because it was already established as a feature of the Targaryen tribe, and there is just no emotional dimension to the act because there is no connection to or between the characters. Overall quite disappointing."
"Lots of discussion around legitimacy of claims. Very little content, no relatable characters (it does not help that actors change in the middle of the series), no focus on experiencing another world. It lacks all the Charme of game of thrones, the different storylines, the big threat, the fighting scenes,the different cultures and landscapes of Westeros. It is a pure listing of events that led up to the targaryens losing the throne. The worst is that the actors for the main characters change in the middle of the series which makes you lose all connection you build throughout the first couple of episodes ."
"Everything revolves around one single subject in all ten episodes. There's no plot, really, no story. There are no interesting characters, the dialogues are weak - in form and in substance - and the performances are well below average, with maybe two or three exceptions. I agree with other reviewers who have described it as ""soapy"", and those who have pointed out how dark the picture is. It's inevitable to compare it to GoT without quickly seeing how inferior it is. The script, the production, the cast. I watched the entire season and had to push myself to get to the end, because I don't like to stop half way, but I found it hard to stay engaged."
"Not as good as GoT but I didn't expect it to be. I'm hoping it gets better. I'll continue to watch, at least, for the time being.I know looks shouldn't matter but they do. I miss Emilia Clarke who not only looks much better than the daughter but seems to be a much better actor.Action scenes were good as was the gore but otherwise I found myself looking at the clock. Not a good sign especially for the first episode.So, I gave it a five in hopes of it improving. Had it been a movie I probably would have given it a four, maybe even a three."
"I am up to ep6 and I am completely bored and annoyed. Every bit of the story feels forced not fluid. What made GOT great was the fluidity of the progression of characters and the story itself. HOD feels like a repetition of the GOT but in a bad way. NO SPOILERS but ep5 and the party was horrendous. Regardless, the story is their but the Directors want to force the story and it CLEARLY shows that it is under ""New Management"".After watching the first 3-4 episodes of GOT I was hooked. A majority of the time watching TV shows and/or movies, I usually can guess the next steps of the story before it progresses, at this point, I just try to enjoy the unfolding of it.GOT got me guessing most of the time and shocked a lot of the time. The progression of the characters was magnificently done.HOD has no shock or guessing, just more of ""Really, this is what they come up with?"" while I am watching it unfold into 3-4 star show."
"I Know that the Original Game of Thrones raise the bar pretty high, but this prequel to GOT is really boring it lacks the good writing, the acting, The complexity of characters that made GOT so great. Two points to make, first the time jumps are a huge distraction that instead of helping move the narrative forward it creates a confusing history line. Second in this type of series, is very important for the audience to empathize with the main characters (I felt the pain with Hodor's death, I felt sorry for Cersei walk of shame or the shock of the red weeding) that is a great character development when the audience become an extension of the characters but in this series by adding and deleted characters so often, there is not enough time to feel anything for them, this whole series It feels rushed is more important to move the narrative than to develop the characters, Not sure if is the fault of the directors, producers, or writers but they just left the bar on the floor!"
"Sadly this series had some budget problem. I know some xbox games better than this shows effects. Colorgrading is terrible everything mostly looks like green or yellow. ( peoples face to hair and backround scene) effects are looking so so old like from 2000 early. Dragon and castles/ houses city they look so fake... this targaryan girls hair looks terrible and she doesnt look pretty in that fake wig as well. Why its like old King Arthur style things going on... ? Terrible and terrible... couldnt watch more than episode i couldnt look that Targaryan girl face and her fake hair.from that point i dont know what to write , because i have to fill many wirds to revuew which actually its done what i wanted to say."
"I was looking forward to this show, as a true fan of GOT and ASOIAF for many years. I think the show lacks everything that GOT had which made the show so successful. Firstly, there's the horrific casting. By no means do I believe that characters have to be good-looking, but the Targaryens are supposed to look regal and enchanting. The characters had the opposite effect. They looked like ugly people with fake blonde wigs. The actress playing Rhaenyra can act decently but she has no screen presence, unlike Daenerys or Viserys and is completely forgettable. She doesn't look the part, and isn't convincing. Furthermore, her storyline isn't well written. All she does is give birth and she's dull without any light-hearted moments with other characters. In GOT, they balanced tragedy with comedic moments effortlessly. There's basically no storyline. Viserys names Rhaenyra as his heir and keeps her in that position, before stupidly remarrying and having two sons in patriarchal Westeros. There's literally no story nor any character depth. Only Daemon has some layers and Matt Smith becomes the character even though he can't pull off the Targaryen look. Even Smith can't save this joke of a show. It's like the show fails to make us care about these characters. Viserys is another unattractive character, both in personality and looks. Nothing really sticks with you. What's the point of this prequel if there's no story and a bunch of dragons flying with dramatic music in the background? Why is there no story?This show pales in comparison to most shows. Casting is bad. Writing is bad. Visuals good.The show is lucky that GOT was so successful because it has saved them from being bashed for their trash writing."
"Knowing that george is involved in this makes me even more disappointed, the series is bad and the cinematography is terrible.I gave it 4 because it's the first episode but as the whole series becomes available I'll update this is not even close to what GOT was...and the characters are not like they are portrayed in the books... G. R. R is crazy this show has no essence it's mangled and meaningless."
"Paddy Considine is always solid (see 'Pride') , as is Matt Smith (see 'Doctor Who'), but they don't have the greatest script here.The imagined towns are a curious mix of the Byzantine, Gothic and Romanesque, and yet the drama is more Baroque.I'm sure it will improve, but it's a bit saggy and trope laden."
"At the end of episode 9 of season 1 of House of the Dragon, why Princess Rhaenys Targaryen riding her dragon, did not burn all the Greens on the stage at the coronation of Prince Aegon Targaryen: Ser Otto Hightower, Queen Alicent Hightower, Prince Aegon Targaryen, Prince Aemond Targaryen, Princess Helaena Targaryen, etc...? She had the opportunity to kill them all and avoid a future war and bloodshed. Instead, she chose to destroy parts of the building where the falling stones hurt and killed the innocent common people who were forced to attend the coronation. She then commanded her dragon to just scream at the Greens. This doesn't make sense. The Greens are monsters, they broke their vows to King Viserys and hanged who opposed them."
"Ok show but way too dark, impossible to watch during daytime and even at night still hard to see, i know the creators are going to say adjust your tv but impossible to make the black colours more visible no matter what you do, just makes no sense to me spending so many millions on a tv show and then you cant see half of it, well atleast they saved alot of money on the power bill maybe they foresaw the energy crysis i dont know.What i have been able to see, the story seems fine starts out slow a lot of talking but hopefully it picks up soon a little more action, but dont know if im going to keep watching."
"I yawned like 5 times 30 minute's in... Daenerys lookalike saying Blablablabla i dont want to marry i want to be a warrior blablabla... I still remember every little detail of the first episode of GoT original....this is the prequel to that masterpiece.. Jesus... Who directed this D. And D again??? Atleast make it political, interesting, quick witted, awesome character interactions, like GOT is supposed to be.....whats up with it revolving around some lady not wanting to marr, what is this soap opera??? If DissapointMent has another meaning then its called house of dragon. Please stop, regroup, revise, get GR martin onboard, introduce some awesome characters and give justice to GOT..."
"I'd have liked to enjoy this series but I can't. It has no resemblance to the gripping vivacity and life in the story and characters of GOT. So OK no, it's not GOT. But where's the fire, the drive and connection between characters. Yes they're related by family but it's so slow and lugubrious there's no immediate recognition of connection between any of them. Some characters are really boring and continue too long. The scenes are so dark and uninteresting unless outside in daylight. So many minuses for enjoyment.For record I was caught up in GOT episodes until final and like many others, so disappointed. It is what it is."
"I truly tried to give it a shot... But no matter how many times during the first 10 minutes they called a complete stranger ""the princess"" , it didn't work. Imagine watching ""Forrest Gump"" with four different actors instead of brilliant Tom Hanks. How relatable it would be? Or ""Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" - we would probably have an opportunity to enjoy six or seven of them if ""House of the Dragon"" crew got a hand on that. I am not sure what was the reason behind the change in multiple cast members, but if it's truly to accommodate the age difference, it could be postponed for at least another decade in the script. Molly Alcock is 22. I'm pretty sure she could play a 28 year old.My previous 8 star-rating became just one."
"Well to be fair the intended audience appears to be young women and girls so my rating probably doesn't count with them. I assume that, other than those with financial attachments, they are the ones rating this higher.Everything about the show felt cheap, like in an afternoon 'kidult' show. Poor acting, cheap props, dire script, routine plot - or at least one where we can see the whole thing before it happens.One episode was more than enough for me."
"It's just bad. You think it will predictably bad, like you can see how bad it's going to be, so it's not interesting. But then there is a curve ball, and they make it worse, in a different way. It has no depth or umph behind it. The entire season is so flat and pointless, building up and building up. And then crescendoing into a ball of predictable badness that in unpredictably worse than you thought it would be.If your watching and thinking ""I'm gunna power through to see if it gets better, it can't stay this bad, I gotta see how it ends"", no you don't. It's unimaginative and there are scenes that ""edgy"" people would want to call ""dark"" that serve zero purpose other than to leave the viewer with more evidence these writers had zero clue what to do."
"I thought I was going to see a strong fight for the throne between the Princess R. And Prince Daemon, but it ended up being them lusting for each other and then living a trashy, whoring life. There are no political struggles, alliances, strategies, or battles. The plot is so weak... just about marriage, giving birth, birthrights, whoring, and children fighting. So lame! No suspense, no thrills, no guessing game around villains, no epic fights.The other problem with this show is the poor cinematography. The lighting is so poor, half the time I'm staring at pitch black. There is no contrast nor highlights in the dark scenes. At least deal with the poor shots through post processing.The only good thing is the acting. Just too bad they're acting to characters that are so weakly written and inconsistent.Anyhow just don't expect coming in to watch anything near the level of plot twists and excitement as the early seasons of Game of Thrones. This is just some simple family drama."
"Disappointing, boring, slow, dull, poorly shot (dim scenes trying to be something that they aren't)Really, this is just another cash grab attempt from movie studio, like for eg. Rings of Power and many more.This show has basically no story, not one character that stands out (in fact all characters are dull and flat), no thrill etc. There is nothing that makes you want to watch the next episode asap.My wife stopped watching this after first episode, I've watched all 3, but that's it.How this got 8.8 score here and in other places only show that either 1) all scores are rigged/buyed 2) people's standards and intellect have diminshed greatly nowadays :/"
"Rhaenera's character is insufferable. Why must all shows be centered around selfish, whiny, spoiled brats these days? ""Woe is me, I'm a princess and they want me to get married! I'm a female, so I'm jealous of my little brother despite the fact that my dad went out on a limb and made me his heir!"" Seriously? Stop trying to force this narrative down our throats.Some of us enjoy period pieces because we get a glimpse of tradition. Why can't we see what life was really like when men were masculine and women were feminine. Ugh. What a disappointment.I loved the original GOT (after I got over all the incest in the earliest seasons). I hoped this one would be equally thrilling and well done. It is not."
"This series is a lack luster, plainly scripted attempt at capturing the essence of GoT but all it really does is ride it's coat tails and not to success - there are no sensational characters so far (up to S01 E05) maybe Daemon but none other that are really well developed or exciting like so many in GoT. The main character, the princess, is too young to lead this part of the series to greatness.However that said, it is still watchable and certainly has potential to improve if they bring in some great writers.The story line feels like it's slow burning and could be going somewhere interesting so let's hope it gets there soon!"
"I only made it through two episodes. The issue is this show forgot what GoT did well: it gave us clear good guys to root for. The graphic violence and masochism that was often too much even in GoT had impact because the Starks and later protagonists mattered.This series has the hallmark brutality, but it's happening to characters who are most clearly defined or delineated as not the bad guys (and how do we know they aren't bad? Well they aren't doing the violence, but we've but seen them do anything particularly worthy).The worst part is it just ends up being dull. Sure the production value is there. It's polished, but it's a prepackaged, cash grab follow up project with zero heart or soul."
"Like everyone else i heard that a mega production was released following on the epic GOT franchise... well it seems that the only thing they picked up from GOT was the last season with no writers... just another patchwork of nice CGI, medieval scenery. AND WAOW...last minutes of episode 5 and episode 6 make you feel like they litterally lost the script or half the crew and decided to keep going. They lost me there. At that point you realise they just went for reusing all the props and CGI from GOT with a bunch of actors wearing wigs having sex or dying here and there... the most fun you'll have is listening to the GOT intro theme music. I gave it a 2/10 just for pulling it off, making me beleive it could go somewere for 5 episodes. Honestly i would have stop after watching the first but couldn't beleive they could mess it up that much."
"Otherwise, it's a major fail, which culminates in episode 6, when they change some of the most important actors.I stopped watching the show after 10min in this episode.The princess's role and actress were intriguing, a mix of under age eroticism and annoyance.The king does not stir anything.Overall content of battles and action is 1/10 - it's incredible how low they invested in it.Plots and dialogues are too long and not interesting. Miles away from the plots in GOT.Maybe the show would have rebounded after the change of characters in ep.6, but I was too bored of nothing actually happening until then, so rational decision is to stop losing my time."
"I love slow burns, and i also love fast burns. This show has neither so far, its like we have been thrown in the middle of an Oprah show episode.There is no plot, just a girl (she's supposed to be 10-14 years old) who refuses to get married, but she also doesn't want anything else. She is basically a bored incel but ultimately gets seduced out of the blue by her uncle, and she drops her pants like there is no tomorrow (wtf). So, we have pedos, incest, dragons.. yeah.. That's basically what keeps the attention of viewers. Oh yeah, there was a bad crab guy, he got smushed by the pedo with a kindergarten attack plan.I gave a 6 in hope it gets better and the story doesn't evolve around a frustrated woman incel and her emotions.The Crab guy was the most interesting thing/character so far in these 4 episodes, and they killed him like he was a nobody.Dudes, if you are not going to open a show with a bang, at least make a good story or whatever.Ill keep watching bc i love the GOT series. But my patience isnt endless.Edit after ep6: I'm not going to watch this anymore, it's just getting worse. Most shows don't even get 2 chances, I gave this one six. Bye bye."
"First of all, the TV series House of the Dragon really disappointed me. Despite its potential, I think it had too many issues. The script was careless, the dialogues were silly and unconvincing, and the characters were flat and uninteresting. Additionally, I believe many plotlines were developed too slowly, which made the series dull. While some viewers may enjoy it, I consider it a serious step backward. The series suffers from weak acting, uninteresting characters, and a convoluted plot, and the dragon scenes are too numerous and often serve only to fill time.But my biggest disappointment was that the series failed to convey the same epic atmosphere and depth of characters that were in the original series Game of Thrones. I expected compelling characters, breathtaking battles, political intrigue, and unexpected plot twists, but instead, I got a series that seemed empty and frivolous.Therefore, I believe that House of the Dragon is not worthy of its predecessor. It is a failed and boring series. I didn't like its script, characters, and plot development, and I think it's not worth watching."
"I waited until I had seen three episodes before posting a review. The show moves at such a slow pace I found myself bored and restless. Lots of talk and arguments but little action, and the action usually involves dragons near the end of the episode. After seeing the dragon bit in the first two episodes the third time left me unsurprisingly angry. The actors are not really interesting, the king is a confused wimp. Compared to GOT it's hollow, great set and flying dragons but a boring story. Unlike the new Rings of Power which I wasn't so sure of but enjoyed much more. ROP has several storylines and keeps moving, but it is still too early to tell. I will say that after seeing the first two episodes of ROP I wanted more. With HOTD I was just glad it was over."
"...the plot is rather thin. What made GOT interesting was all the timelines and locations on the map. Here we get King's Landing and hardly anything else.Most of it has been a bunch of men m sitting around a table, talking politics and who to marry. Not much action, not much variery between the characters either. And only one interesting female so far, the (very few) others are just the normal fantasy woman who needs a man in their life and has no interests and no depth.It's also not very clear what's the goal for the characters. Is there an enemy? What is their mission/conflict?The dragons are cool as always, but I wish we saw more of them. The interactions between them and the characters etc.I've watched 4 episodes and will continue, though I can't say I look forward to new episodes eagerly... I hope they will add more side stories with time."
"If you put GOT aside and watch this show on its own merits it still falls way short of being ""watchable """
And it's definitely not even the same league as GOT. I waited 6 episodes thinking it might take off eventually but never did.its still taxing stopping turn taxing again.Atrocious cast selection baring Otto who is now gone for example Dr who is the mindless warrior...yep totally fitting. Sub-par acting and story more bland than sugar free ice cream makes for a show just a little more entertaining than watching paint dry.Only thing going for it is CGI which in this day is no achievement at all.
"I am currently on episode 3. This series is associated with 'Games of Throne' because the talentless money-grubbers demanded it. In contrast to most period fantasy dramas of this type - HoD is a very simple & childish tale that wears GoT like a cheap suit.Also, there's a sub-theme revolving around women not having the same rights as men. Doesn't seem to fit the era and there's no nuance to it. In GoT, these issues were dealt with by having a woman prove herself (Daenerys Targaryen, Cersei Lannister, Arya Stark, Brienne of Tarth, Ygritte, Yara Greyjoy) - virtually all of them.In House of Dragon, it's a privileged expectation that goes like this... If people don't like me in this male role (and I clearly haven't earned the right), I'll step into the role anyway because I'm special.It's the typical writing you see from immature writers that are more interested in making a point than making that point through actual story-telling (like in GoT).It's ugly, there's no nuance and no joy for the viewer. You are simply being preached to.----------------------After 2+ episodes, it's mostly about an entitled teenage princess who wants to be Queen. That's it! No layers, no other mainline stories, no other characters.There is dialogue centering around her soft-bellied Father (The Beta King), her uncle (the weird prince who is either a warrior, a drunk, a dummy or unhinged... portrayed as all four) but it's mostly about a privileged teenage girl. As such... there's an awful amount of pouting, no action and lots of complaining that life is not fair when she imagines she doesn't get her way.The show is so badly written that nobody does anything worthy, including our heroine. She has done nothing to merit anything accept for mastering the art of pouting.Frustratingly... the show is written in such a way that we're suppose to feel empathy for her - as this character is the only one that's being fully developed (in a cardboard way). All the others are just simple supporting caricatures.If you are a teenage girl who wants to be a princess someday, fancies dragons and still believes in unicorns - this series is for you.If you are the type that's easily impressed with gowns, ancient wardrobes, lots of long white/yellow hair, hairdos in general and castles... but no plot whatsoever: This series is for you too because an actual story is so mundane.If you are like me - hoping that after 2+ episodes it will turn things around - we are probably wasting our time. I'm going to stick with this a little longer anyway because...The princess just ran off on a horse. It was the crazy pouting that hinted something was wrong. She was upset that she's suppose to start seeing the world through adult eyes. All she wants to be is queen with no responsibilities. Why can't people understand this! Poor girl...Oh... did I mention that she's being chased by a knight in shining armor? Her protector. I kid you not. The horror that is her life.Ok... going back in. Unpausing episode 3 at the 18min, 29sec mark. Wish me ughh!-----------------------------final update, 25nov2022: Made it thru 1/3 of episode 5. I'm done. The talentless, money grubbing hacks - like vultures - pecking away at the memory of GoT for easy cash. They win (again), we lose (again)."
"There's no emotion in the cast. There's no real chemistry between any of them. No budget for the setting and world they live. The story is pretty predictable, boring and slow. The pacing is also very slow. It lacks good tension. The CGI is okay at best; the city overview doesn't look real and the dragons just don't live up to the quality they had in Game of Thrones.The whole show kinda feels soulless. It can't capture my attention either. I probably sound like an old nag but I think it's fair to compare it Game of Thrones because the entire show feels like a money grab for people who liked that show. It does read like a book so that might be the only good point, but it's so so blend.It drives a lot on fan service but that's all there really is."
"This show is absolute garbage. They are taking the big GOT name and stroking their ego. The casting is 80% terrible. The acting is absolutely atrocious. The dialog and character development is pathetic, laking any sense of character ark, growth or depth; it is blunt and immediately gratifying. Worse yet the sound and visuals are over produced to hide its faults. This show is a failure. With as much money as they show has, one would think that they could produce wigs that weren't so disgusting; I can focus on little else while watching. This is infinitely worse than even the worse of the ending of GOT. GRRM has clearly been gelded in this production."
"Preposterous wigs, dull characters and miscasting. After a promising start this stutters and goes nowhere as a pale imitation of the original GOTs. There are over long scenes with pointless dialogue which will have you pressing fast forward. The violence and sex of GOTs is still here but somehow irrelevant.In its favour are some great set pieces and wonderful scenery enhanced by CGI. The score creates the right atmosphere. Sadly though this is not enough to save the great houses from boredom. By the end of it you have stopped caring what happens to any of the characters that drift in and out of this expensive soap opera with dragons."
"When the season first began, this show wasn't too bad. It was beautiful and held some promise, even though being G-Rated compared to GOT. However, the moment they suddenly switched from childhood to adulthood for Rhaenyra Targaryen, it began a rapid decline. To say the writers and producers started to 'phone it in' in a major way would be even too complimentary. It is a disjointed wreck of a snooze. There's no 'hard-hitting' drama. There's no 'flow.' There's no courage. There are no longer any interesting characters. To say the story is being badly told is another understatement. What a waste of time,effort, and money. Boring, dull, unenjoyable in every way... It leaves one wondering why they even bothered if they weren't even going to try to put on a decent show."
"Slow, boring, nowhere near the quality of the original GOT. With exception of Damien, the characters are uninteresting. Episodes are difficult to see, mostly shot in dark. Had to turn on CC since difficult to hear also, alot of whispers and heavy accents. Better off just watching the original again. HBO max should have took more time and come up with an original story, maybe focusing on Essos instead of Westeros. The dragons are diritive, and poorly used in the story. Very disappointing overall but unfortunately, since HBO has fallen behind with original series programming, will stick it out and finish the first season."
"Yes the last series of Game Thrones was terrible, no we didn't like the way it ended. But this weak generic clone of the original feels like a sad cash grab. At no point did I feel engaged or entertained. Not a single character mattered to me. I've never understood why people like Matt Smith, I think he ruined Dr Who and he's a lazy actor who seems to phone in every performance from a distance with no real emotion. He's awful in this.Every scene with a dragon is more watchable but it's still just not entertaining. The endless talking and politics is dull here. I love a bit of Shakespearean drama like Succession but all the tedious family drama broken up by the tiniest bit of action simply does not carry this.You have none of the guts of the original, and none of the casting and acting strength of the original. I just struggle to care and that wasn't the case with the original: week by week you hung out for the next ep. This though? Eh, go read one of the books, it will entertain you more than this. Lord they spent so much money on it - it cost a fortune. And I struggle to care.TV in the modern age. It's all maths and metrics and they figured they had the formula to hook us in. They do not."
"House of the rarely anything happening, save the infighting of feuding family members who always forget your birthday. There isn't a worthwhile character amongst the lot all scraping for a seat around a big table in a large, dark cold room.Damsel not in distress, Alisent marries widower King, who despite his position is the only one who hasn't had a dental plan. His curious season long ailment results in him looking like Iron Maiden's Eddie, whilst his wife Queenie 2 ends up having children- Dick Dastardly and egg-on-cress who can scarcely be much younger than their mother. There is a touch of the Timelord about several characters as they regenerate into slightly different life forms, many of whom seem to have inherited a case of party wig.Everyone pretends that they serve the King when really they serve his hand whilst the other doesn't know what it's doing. Heaven forbid that the throne passes to a female, oh..."
"Hard to concentrate on the story when the London accent is so strong. I've seen a lot of positive feedback, probably sponsored, but the truth is that ""House of Dragon"" is weak and boring. It would've been nice to have American accents as they are more soft and not so evidently British, which makes the whole show a parody of itself. Not even the fast blood makes the show interesting or entertaining. This is another great example of how HBO tries to extend the success of a franchise until the infinity and far beyond, and with hilarious consequences! Mainly the contemporary English voices makes it fake & cheap!"
"It feels like George Martin has allowed the success of Game of Thrones to enable him to endulge in some pretty gross fantasies that are not only unnecessary to the storyline but make the show difficult to watch.99% of the characters are hard to like and you spend almost every episode just hoping that one of the dragons is going to go feral and wipe out everyone, honestly if that happens in the final episode i will change this review to 10 out of 10 just for the satsifaction of knowing that they wont be any in potential future second season.Honestly i wish I could give this 0 starts because its that bad."
"Having watched all seasons of GOT and read all the released novels, I'm a bit of a fan of asoisf. This, was something else, I did not care for this. I will watch episode 2, but I will abandon the whole thing if it continues in such a plodding manner."
"Who at HBO approved this? That person should be fired.I'm thinking they should have gone back to the beginning of the Targaryens and how they became dragon riders. Maybe that would have been more interesting. This writing, acting, plot lines suck."
Everything bad in this movie:
"1. Casting. It's terrible, really. Acting of characters is super weak. They playing Santa Barbara roles. Not GoT prequel. What a shameful acting.2. Script. No twists. I can't even find myself interested not even once. GoT hooked me from series 1.3. CGI. Guys,.some new games like RDR2 at ultra do better picture In realtime that this awfully render.4. Even music - it's the same! Bc they want to hype upon GoT.5. Mat Smith as a maniac selfish lover? Cmone ! Not s dime! Even in sex scene he is still some geek turned inside himself and rly not that kind of person.6. Remember GoT when every charachter, every spin, worth and fun and intriguing to whatcha and follow. Here - nothing even close."
"The original series contained a range of interesting characters all bent on forming unusual alliances and ultimately bringing about one anothers destruction. So far in the new series there are NO interesting characters at all, nothing interesting has happened, the plot is weak and mundane. This whole effort appears to be a forced milking of the original series on the basis of a commision to create anything, in the expectation that people will watch. Where are all the high profile actors? Where is the multifacted plot line of the original, with multiple threads forming, multiplying, then eventually coming together."
"Really I didn't expect they can make it that bad, I was waiting for this show expecting the show maker learned from the big disappointment "" at least mine"" of GOT Se8.But I am so disappointed again so boring and bad casting with weak story almost have nothing to tell.The over rated made me confused I thought maybe be I miss something so I waited episode and another.. ok one more.. but it's not even close to be promising.. may be they can do better next seasons or for another GOT based show but I am sure that this season have nothing to say more it is already dead.. I will not continue with this show."
"I've seen all episodes of GOT 5 times. Think I love it? Absolutely! Just watched EP 7 of this thoughtless exercise. It finally showed some teeth but I don't think many folks will get this far. Not one single actor has even a little charisma. What a waste. Instead of changing actors mid-season, they should have begun with the main characters and used the young ones in flashbacks. A complete lack of vision and imagination. And where is the beautiful King's Landing? Some of it must exist. Did the 7 kingdoms just pop up in the following 400 years, or what? They thought that a story about one family would hold our attention? I'll watch the rest of the episodes but I'm in no hurry."
"Not sure if it is the director's or producer's fault. They all know that GoT fans would watch this.After watching 7 episodes, my impression is that this feels like a story telling, not immersive enough for viewers. Yes, I am spoilt by GoT and its sensational, shocking twists which I wasn't able to predict most of how the main plot would results in someone's death.The house of dragon abandoned layers of in depth characters' inner feelings. The screens are trying to tell for viewers. By romanticizing the relationships, or by grand theatrical acting and camera works(when Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys had a disagreement on how they should pursuit family legacy). You already feel like You are only a viewer, you are watching a scene. Not being invested in the characters' inner conflict because the scenes are already giving them to viewers. Two dimensional characters won't help win over GoT trained viewers.All those rushed plots makes me feel like 'this is what could've been if GoT didn't have enough high viewer rate, which would have ended the series with two season.'"
"Please this feels like Transformers movie, all gets to be resurrected despite of how many times you get killed.I hope they turn this and change the screen writer as well as the producer."
"The original series is so much better than this. In Game of Thrones, the conversations were the action scenes. Characters subtlety and sometimes not so subtlety jousting each other with words. Each character flushed out and vivid. Every episode ending with you on the edge of your seat, wanting to know what was going to happen the next week. The focus was jumping around from character to character never quite crossing the line to too much, but competently communicating the story with multiple focuses.House of the dragon, on the other hand, doesn't have very vivid characters. The uncle character is obviously the most interesting, but other than that everybody's kind of boring. The conversations are definitely not like action scenes, as they are bland and boring themselves. You've taken Game of Thrones and turned it into a coming of age drama. The focus constantly stays on the most boring repetitive characters, who barely move the story forward as they keep doing and saying the same things over and over again. How this has such a high rating, I have no idea."
"After the horrible ep 3, I had to go start watching GOT again to wash my brain out. Starts at the Wall, one of the many non-human, mostly mysterious characters which made it so good, that HOTD doesn't have, not one. Winter, White Walkers, dragons (unseen for so long), the Wildlings. And the Houses, oh the Houses, each one a little series in itself with wonderful characters. And Sean Bean to open (great chemistry with King Robert). The producers gave the actors what they needed to craft amazing characters. Plus they were amazing actors. Each scene was rich and full of people. HOTD seems like one small soap opera scene to another. Lonely. And mostly terrible acting. The poor little princess rich girl thing has been done, and better. If I hear about ""his heir"" one more time... Just lazy writing and we get it, already!In GOT, the women, the brown, and the downtrodden just took their power, no messing around. And the diverse characters were some of the best, because they had the richest stories. Not just handsome blond princes and princesses. While there were some cringey medieval moments, it was, after all... medieval. The Black lord of HOTD is one of the few good actors and compelling characters in the series so far. I guess people who complain about diversity can't hear how awful they sound. And who justify such bigoted complaints with ""source material"". If we stuck faithfully to ""source material"", we'd still be watching 1950s shows.Anyway, I don't think there's any way to elevate HOTD, things are set, at least for the 1st season. Even the last miserable season of GOT was better. But people so want to relive GOT that they elevate this POS, but just remember that HOTD is to GOT as The Hobbit movies were to LOTR. A pale imitation. Speaking of LOTR, we have the exact same situation as HOTD going on as I write... With predictable results."
"I was looking forward to this series but now only watched 2 episodes and I find its terribly slow nothing excitment is going on with the characters. No magical quality or intrigue like GOT had right from the get go with the whitewalkers. This appears to be a political soap opera obsessed with the hiearchy of royal families and their power. There is some interesting dialogue between the niece and king but where is this friendship going?Gee who wrote this, what are they thinking, seems they forgot about the magic and humor GOT portrayed. Episode 2 is talk and more talk about the families the heirs the order of this flop oh well. It is however slow moving perhaps getting interesting that incest is not beyond the princess who lusts for her uncle and power. Perhaps they chose an unattractive actress because of her course taste. I hope it gets better, nothing exciting so far, how do they create the whitewalkers? The wall the nightwatch etc..., so many questions as to how they will meld the two. Its a boring bunch of relatives with no incentive to change thier lineages."
"Three stars for production values, but not my cup of tea. Having never seen Game of Thrones, I thought House of the Dragon would be a good chance to see if I'd missed anything. I didn't."
"Just too much. Jumping ahead in time, new cast members, convoluted story lines. My opinion is it's just a waste a of time.Matt Smith has always been a pile of rocks to me when describing his acting. You can come at me all you Dr. Who fans, but he couldn't convincingly ask for a pail of water if he was on fire. And Paddy Consadine? Just an embarrassment.HBO: Save your money and spare us another season. It's never too late to abandon dreck. This program has a storyline that I found difficult to follow, despite devoting hours to the episodes through episode 8. Just couldn't do it. Maybe the dragons can burn it all to the ground in the season finale?"
"Found myself distracted, got bored with all the talking. Kept picking up my phone , which says a lot i think. I want a show to grip me and draw me in. Hopefully it gets better but for me, there's nothing new here."
"Currently watching episode 8 and still no thrill or any emotional connection with this show. Don't get me wrong, it's nicely shot, there are good sceneries, but everything else looks just mediocre (even the score is nothing as majestic and compelling as in GoT). I will probably finish watching the series but full aware that no intrigue or character development is going to make the watching more interesting.Some of the dialogues are extremely dull and bring nothing to the development of the story, there are too many dead moments and on the other hand some themes are approached in a too dismissive way. A lot of potential getting wasted, which is just too bad."
"Although this series is apparently related to the game of thrones, it does not have such quality and beauty.It's just an overpriced series that you'll get bored of sooner or later. But this is not my problem.When I was watching the Game of Thrones series, I tried to cope with it, the story started with an illicit relationship and was condemned, but After watching four episodes of this series, I realized that in addition to watching the main story, the purpose of encouraging and normalizing adultery is to show. Today's society is not the society of thirty years ago and the impact of such films cannot be ignored.I have decided not to watch this series I may have reduced the number of visitors to this inappropriate content to a small extent."
"Come on guys, how can this, in best case mediocre show have 8.5 stars? Worst episode of GoT is 10 times better than best episode of HoD, it's soooo boring and without any plot that i have to fast forward every now and i still fall asleep 5 times at each episode. And what is that childbirth scenes with literally 5 minutes of nothing but woman screaming for every child that is born in the show. I read somewhere that this show is more expensive than GoT and i really can't imagine where that money is spent. There is not a single star actor here, not even from B list, there is one couple minutes long battle in first 6 episodes that i watched so far, costumes and especially their wigs look cheap, 90% of every episode is filmed inside, with very little light....so how did they spend all that money? Forced diversity and LGBT parts is something that i don't mind so much, if it means something for people from those groups it's ok for me, although it is funny to see second most powerful family with ""pure Valirian blood"" being black, with gay son of course. But as I said, if it means something to them i am fine with it but give us some story god damnit. In original GoT you had dozens of main characters and each of them was so interesting that it could easily have tv show on its own, here we have like 4 or 5 main ones and all of them together have nothing to show except some lame court intrigues. Not to mention that episode 6 switch of all main actors. Like we barely even got invested in them they reset everything and forced us to start from begining. Public don't just get attached to characters guys, but to actors playing them, so when you change them its like reset of our emotions for them, how show writers don't know that its beyond me. I will continue to watch it since now all season is out and I hope i will come back here to update my review but from what I see now there is little chance. Show as it is maybe 3-4 stars but I gave 1 for balance."
"I think this show is totally overrated. I wouldn't even call it a fantasy. It is a list of complaints about medieval times. There are women dying in childbirth, after being forced to have a male heir. Without a male heir they won't accept a woman as queen. There is competing claims to the throne as always. A woman can be killed for committing adultery but not a man. A male heir can be totally unfit and still be king. And so on and on. The only fantasy here is brief scenes with dragons.This show should not be called House of the Dragon, because it is only the middle part of the reign of the Targaryens over hundreds of years. The first part is Aegon the Conqueror, then this, then the Mad King leading up to the Game of Thrones period.What makes me want to quit on this series is when I looked up the history of Westeros and saw that it goes back 12 thousand years and it could lead to many prequal shows over more than twenty seasons. Considering it will take over 2 years to get season 2, I don't think I will live long enough to catch up to game of thrones. Endless prequals and sequels and spinoffs all out of order, and all not based on the writings of Martin, who may not live long enough to complete Game of Thrones novels.Game of Thrones was a classic show but it was often painful to watch, I mean a guy got his ""nick"" cut off and I will never forget things like that. Should I put up with more punishment for the rest of my life.If you want to see spoilers of how this show will end and the other prequels, read the Time article on the History of Westeros."
I just have to say that after watching whats been available so far that the production quality is no where near that of Game of Thrones.It's a shame as the script can hold its own and the acting is good but again the production reminds me of an American day time soap.Time will tell and I hope that they are learning.I just have to say that after watching whats been available so far that the production quality is no where near that of Game of Thrones.It's a shame as the script can hold its own and the acting is good but again the production reminds me of an American day time soap.Time will tell and I hope that they are learning.
"I found the early episodes quite enthralling. They weren't quite as good as the Game of Thrones scripts and screenplay, but the story was building nicely and subsequent episodes progressed well on a solid theme.However I began to lose interest and found myself not hanging on every episode release or paying as much attention to the developments, conversations and twists of fate that unfolded as my viewing progressed.Eight episodes in and its clear there are some serious shortcomings in this production, not in quality of the visuals mind, more in the writing and direction. At times I'm left confused, not because I missed some nuance, or detail escaped me due to the fast paced scenes or depth of detail that occasionally happened in Game of Thrones, but because somethings are just portrayed confusingly or unclearly.There is treachery and deceit and to some extent mild depravity, but this is a far cry from the complexly perceived and executed skulduggery that Game of Thrones entwined so exceptionally into its plot and script. The sharpness of tongue and the clever delivery is missing here and it comes across as a half decent knock-off of the real thing.I found the skipping ahead half a dozen years particularly problematic, not just with the story progression but with the character depiction. Characters like Rhaenyra Targaryen have been very well established and having them portrayed by a new actor does the series and injustice. This isn't a case of changing from a child actor to an adult after they have grown up, which is generally acceptable. This is an young woman in this case Milly Alcock, being substituted for a slightly older one Emma D'Arcy, who grates against the characterisation already set, particularly as she doesn't handle the role as well. This cast change happens with some of the roles while others maintain the original casting which makes things even more incongruous.As you would expect, the series is a cinematic masterpiece, but the direction is also questionable in some places. The screen play and script are the major problems, and I don't think I'm being overly critical when I say the general level of enjoyment has steadily declined. The effervescence of enthusiasm, excitement and eagerness for the next instalment is absent in a way that sadly contrasts my experience with Game of Thrones. I laboured through episode eight's slow boring story with gritted teeth and slowly escalating restlessness that culminated in a strange wave of relief as the credits rolled. Needless to say, I think its the last episode I'm going to suffer, as it's quite simply become a chore to watch.I don't want to make this solely about a comparison between the two series, but in truth Game of Thrones set an incredibly high standard which this series is finding impossible to match. Look its OK generally, but the steady decline in watchability is impossible to ignore and it needs some competent writing to bring it out the the stables of mediocrity where it is comfortably nestled at the moment. I can see the viewership seriously declining if more effort isn't made into making the story more compelling.Give it a watch, as I said before its decent enough to begin with, but I can't in all honesty even give it a solid thumbs up based on entertainment value."
"The first season of House is nowhere near as good as GOT. It seems to follow the same formula as other ""royal dramas"", very soapy with similar power struggles, angst about being rich and powerful as well as tedious, long stretches of one-on-one, boring chatter.There are flashes of the GOT brilliance but they are few and far between. I've read all of Martin's books and this series (from what I can remember) doesn't match the action, imagination or thoughtful narration of his books.I'm hoping that season 2 will seek to rise up to at least some of the brilliance of Game of Thrones.There are also not a lot of likeable characters in this series. My memory of the last book is that there are at least one or two protagonists who one could root for at least a little bit."
"House of the Dragon feels like a cheap version or clone of GoT - the soundtrack is cheesy, the sounddesign one dimensional and rather bad, the special effects sometimes okay, sometimes bad. The cast, well, no match compared to the cast of GoT, this I dare to say. If I compare the first episode of GoT and House of the Dragon - GoT wins the round easy. Watching the first episode of GoT I was sucked in, watching the first episode of House of the Dragon, I was most time bored. House of the Dragon reminds me a lot of"
"Vikings: Valhalla, which is also very inferior to the first seasons of the original Vikings show. Still, this one may be interesting enough for hardcore lovers of dragons and those who need their dose of fantasy no matter what quality is served. But me? Disappointed."
"I am not sure why people don't point out at all how dark is this series compared to GoT. I love the actors and how they act but damn where is the luminosity in this tv show? It's actually pathetic to tell me that to be able to watch it properly it has to be full dark outside, and in my room and stuff like that, and even if this requirements are fulfilled, it's still way too dark. Only reason It kept me going are the dragons. I understand it's easier to use microled screens for the background, but hell we don't own microled tvs to be able to watch properly your show-it cost like 15 k. I hope this matter will be brought into discussion in season 2 and make it worth it, not just milk your audience."
"It doesn't have the suspense that GoT had at the very start. There's a lot of talking by the characters about their emotions in most scenes. GoT always shocked you in every episode, wether it was pushing Bran out the tower window to Arya slaying the Night King. Something I never did during an episode of GoT I found myself doing this first episode of House of The Dragon, I read my daily emails. I hope the coming episodes have the same intense shocks and suspense that GoT had and this first episode was just a slight stumble towards a fantastic series."
The latest episode The Princess and the Queen has slipped in the production values clearly being shot on a sound stage with all the quality of a TV soap opera. Hey I realize that many shots are on a sound stage but most of the time that fact doesn't jump out at you and slap you in the face like this episode did. HBO has a stinker with this one.And the story is uninteresting with so many weak characters. The writing is sophomoric and unimaginative. And the gratuitous sex scenes like the young man naked and pleasuring himself caught by his mother didn't add anything to the story. Oh if there were only a Joffrey or Ramsay character to make the story interesting. And the king!!! If he is an example of Targaryen kings no wonder they lost powerA big P! U! Not worth my continued viewership.
"I was really looking foward to liking this but after the time jump I kind of fell off the wagon. The scenes are really long and i think the dialogue is too sparse. It's a lot of looks with atmosphere music but I honestly don't understand where the characters are coming from or how they feel. I have to wait so long for them to open up that as a viewer I don't understand what's happening in some scenes. Raenyra irritates me. She said she cared about duties and that she ""is the crown"" but makes out with her uncle in her own wedding in front of everyone and is shook when the children of men who don't look like her husband raise questions but yet it wasn't just one and after that some reflection about how it's going to effect her. She kept going to the point where it's absurd for her position as next heir to the iron throne. Daemon is at least consistent as a character but he also just kind of does things and then the plot just jumps in time again."
"I wanted more excitement. How many times can a woman complain about a baby in one show? The characters are as plain as the script. Non interesting faces I could pass by on the street and not remember. Would adding a couple of exceptionally good looking people hurt? I mean after all us homebodies are sitting on the couch to fantasize and be transported. Give us some eye candy. I didn't enjoy the degeneracy. I mean it was just one episode and already so much going on. Too much IMO they could have dragged on some of the story lines for longer. They kill off that lady with the baby and make it into an opportunity to get people to the polls Nov 22. So unnecessary. Some of the characters remind me I'm in 2022 and not in some a fantasy land. Again, I want to escape... This reboot failed me. Not all reboots are bad like Tom Cruise Maverick that was great but this was bad."
A late comer to GOT. It wasn't my style. I tried it once but I ran out of things a few weeks ago and gave it another go and loved it! The Targaryen storyline was never my favorite but I went in hoping it may be a new GOT but I was mistaken. The acting to me is subpar and I love Milly Alcock in other things but the one knight was the only one I cared for. The violence is stupid and gratuitous and the brothers are awful! The wigs look ridiculous and they've so much make up on Daemon and it looks like they fattened his face?!?Oh Graham McTavish is the only decent actor. They want to marry the king to ? What a 12 year old so he can hurry and have an heir to someone who probably won't have her menses for many years. Yeah I'm probably in the minority but I bet many other GOT fans are wanting to like it but they really don't..
I'm editing after watching all episodes released thus far! How could anyone think this good?!? Viscery is still alive?!? They have him looking like a monster but there just isn't a story!!! One thing for sure is every episode someone will give birth or die! Who cares?!? Things just randomly happen. Characters that were gone are suddenly back? Characters change in beliefs from one episode to the next! All of a sudden Rhaenyra and Daemon want to be scheming and all of a sudden she cares about being queen?!? The worst part was the one scene where I spotted Graham McTavish standing there looking like he didn't want to be there all for a 10 second scene where he has like 4 lines!! A great actor like him reduced to that?! This c##p is awful! They do nothing and the writers or directors and their 10 min synopsis on the episode is a joke!
"Finding it very difficult to care for this show. It has the same old premise - women can't rule in this world but somehow this teenage Rhaenyra is going to rule, but no one wants her to rule so she's going to have to keep fighting people who oppose her. All of this begs the question - who cares about who ascends the throne? It's so boring!! The villains are all boring lords and they're no match for dragons - so why should we care?! Also, Rhaenyra is annoying - very obstinate and oversmart at the age of 17 and so far has the same story arc of Arya if Arya wanted to be queen. Nothing happens in this show!! They go on a hunt and Rhaenyra gets attacked by a boar - soooo??! The king kills a deer - soooo?!?"
"I am just gonna say, this series is just fan service for the Targaryen stans. Like apart than Paddy's King Viserys amazing job and Daemon, because Matt Smith, there is NO character development, no attachment to any of them, if they died, no tears drop, trust me, compare from what was the core of Game of Thrones.We all know Robert's Rebellion is way more interesting and should be done! Watching your vicious prince Rhaegar die will give me more relief than a thousand CGI dragons. #makerobert'srebellionnow.Btw: come on why use the Game of Thrones theme, be more original and do a new one that can fit in this show."
"If you like nudity and extremely graphic violence, this is the series for you. It takes all the bad bits from Game of Thrones, and combine it with a script that is barely coherent, and previously great actors like Matt Smith, Rhys Ifans and Paddy Considine that are being scripted and directed to death.It is going to rot your mind.The positive side is that the CGI is awesome, but no more than one has come to expect of a production with this budget. And I'm sorry, not even a gold dragon is going to save this trainwreck. No amount of copying of the battle of the b-stards or other awesome CGI scenes is going to give this series any substance at all. Hopefully it is cancelled after one season so that it makes room for something with a bit more substance.You will not find a production that screams ""milking the franchise"" more than this (and yes, I am aware that there are several obvious candidates for such a title). It is so overt that I wouldn't be all that surprised if GRRM and the showrunners are laughing and thinking they can't believe they got away with this garbage."
"The producers still has not learned what they got wrong in GOT and why it went to hell after 4th season. GOT season 1 was the best TV ever in my openion. The house of dragon is more of the same bullsh!# that carried GOT to the grave.They got too complicated, too fine, too expensive sets, more and more of poor CGI and most of all messy and little stories to tell. They lost touch with both the books and people's hearts. This is more of the same. In short they tried too much. Go back and watch GOT season 1 and you'll see what I'm talking about.Episode 6 Samantha forgot to bring her birthmark but thats it. 😂👍"
Is it greed? Is it the limelight? What causes men to trample all over their work! I had free HBO for week and couldn't stomach it...there is like no one on this show but sweet Paddy and Ryhes(?)! GOT had mostly memorable characters and dialogue where as this is all NOT! The princess is devastatingly trite with her attitude and I do t know the whole thing just stink...they should have done a show about strange Targaryen's coming to Westeros instead of jumping what 175 yrs only in the past! They should have drastically changed the customs made them more primitive or something but what we get is a bad image and imitation of GOT!
Loved episode 1-5 and was positively surprised. But then in EP6 almost the whole cast was changed and the story went southways. And what's with the endless scenes of women giving birth? Just don't. It had so much potential but trumbled halfway through.Absolutely loved EP 1-5 with Milly Alcock as Rheanyra. I haven't seen the last episodes yet. But I really don't get why they spend so much money on a series and then make such a big change halfway through.Also Daemon did not age? He a vampire? King Viserys looks as if he's 80 years old form EP6 and Daemon shows still in his 40's.It's just irritating how many mistakes where made on a sjow so expensive.
"I just finished watching Season 1, and I have no idea why this show is getting good ratings.Visually, very cool. Story, meh - it was slow, boring, and predictable. Unlike ""Game of Thrones"" (pre last season), there was complexity and intrigue. Season 1 of HoD would have been condensed to one episode, maybe two, of GoT. But, unlike GoT, most of the key characters are replaced due to age issues, making it tough to remember who is who, from episode to episode, and even worse, the plot is so thin, there is no reason to remember them anyway.It's like a worse version of the Hobbit: A small book that was stretched too much. This is a very thin story, without any of the complexity, depth, or intrigue which made GoT so great (aside from Season 8).For me, it missed as a drama, adventure, and sci-fi. I'm glad I'm done, but I miss the 10 hours I'll never get back."
"The politics are now 90% of the content and the problem is that they are utterly boring... action is slow paced and the story is quite linear. While GOT always told 5 or 6 stories at the same time, in this series it is one and it just does not grab Me. Just like as the world turns....Next to this the characters are not nearly as captivating as for example little finger, varis, Joh, the hound, teryon, Danny, our favorite twins and I could go on with list with at least 5 names. But in the HOD? I can't say any of the characters impress me. They are not special in any way and their actions are predictable because the story is so shallow.A real big missed opportunity."
"Started interesting but then the unnecessary time jumps happened, also cant relate to characters, good actors but the character arc is as dull as it can get.The episodes are all over the place, it's either one thing happens and show concentrates on it for far too long or too much is happening and none of it is dived in deeply.Overall, very disappointed since all i heard from people is how amazing it is and how interesting, however not impressed. I will check out season 2 just to see if anything is changed for the better, if still missed im just going to stop watching it at all.So far not good."
"I have been watching steadily but getting more and more frustrated as the story continues to go, in seven episodes, where it could have gone in two. It's borderline torture and so disappointing after the complexity and pace of GOT.No one is particularly likable or interesting. The story is not original or compelling and I have not gotten through one episode without nodding off.Bad writing is an epidemic in premium streaming services in the COVID and Post-COVID era, but House of the Dragon doesn't just have bad writing, it adds an extra kick in the butt to viewers by having bad wigs. One of GOT's feats was making everyone's fake hair look real. Dragon just doesn't even try. Maybe the wig budget got cut or the containers from China with the good wigs were stuck in customs. Note to producers: hair is just as important as costumes and lighting.I'm sad this show is such an expensive mistake. I really want to like it."
"I very much enjoyed the beginning couple of episodes - I thought the characters were interesting. It was very much like Game of Thrones except for some slightly cringey dialogue. However, once the show fast forwarded to show an old Rhaenyra and Allicent it really lost its edge. It turned into a family squabble rather than GOT. The plot line was terrible - how anyone was supposed to believe or accept that Rhaenyra's children were hers baffles me - also how is it that all of Viserys and Alicents children are white haired but Rhaenyra gives birth to only brunettes. Alicent went from being a kind caring character to being one of the least likeable characters in the show and this had no real explanation. Rhaenyras character arc made absolutely no sense - she went from not caring about being queen and having a terrible idea of how the world works to being the smartest person in the room. Daemon was probably the best character at the beginning where he was obviously (i thought) vying for the Iron throne and then all of a sudden he's not anymore and he's just under the thumb of Rhaenyra and whilst still being the best actor in the show in my opinion his character lost all its charm.Why Princess Rhaenys didn't just burn the entire Allicent side of the family alive with her dragon after they crown Aegon makes no sense. I think that part of the show was just for dramatic effect and they didn't see how it could change the plot.Aemond and Luserys' dragon fight at the end made absolutely no sense - why has Aemond chased after him on a dragon at all if he didn't want to kill him? It would have been much better to show Aemond as this calculated killer who fly's in and purposefully kills Luserys for refusing to remove his eye previously. Then we could at least have seen Daemon be replaced as the evil character but instead we now have a very confusing character who seemed strong but is also weak.Saying all of this I will still watch season 2 and see if they can improve on the terrible script writing from this season. But only because it's game of thrones."
"I thought GOT season 8 being worst is just an understatement but then House of Dragons has replaced the disappointment bar to new levels . It's not even illogical but also very convenient to the writer's imagination and has no connection to continuity and logic . If Otto hightower was removed by king due to evil intentions he was again appointed Hand just cuz previous hand died of conspiracy.. Some stupid scenes which has no relevance to logic comes in every episode.. House of Dragons has no brilliant factor that we saw from GOT season 1 to GOT season 7 ... No hero like John snow or Arya stark , No villian like Cersei Lannister, no emotional characters that we feel connected like Robb stark and NO masterpiece character like Tyrion Lannister . It's got no emotion who sits on the throne .."
"I would never imagine myself saying this, but my thoughts while watching these first two episodes were: Guys, we forgive you for the GoT finale season disaster. Please come back now. We need you!'.So far, the most exciting thing about the House of the Dragon is the GoT theme music.While we seem to be in GoT realm, as soon as these characters open their mouths, you realize that you are in something that looks like GoT and feels like a boring period drama. The dialogue is meh, the characters flat, with no spark or sassiness, aliveness, or distinctiveness. The pace is problematic. I hope it gets better, even though book fans are ecstatic -I suspect they are the only ones who will keep watching.I have a hunch that what is missing are the two people who made GoT such a thrilling, amazing, and unpredictable ride. Mark my words: this show needs Weiss and Benioff to make it and probably everyone involved in this production already knows it.-"
"Updates: The third episode had a couple of powerful scenes: 1) The scene with Rhaenyra and Viseris when he gives her permission to find her match b) the scene with Daemon that leads up to the battle. The actors are really good, Matt Smith bravo. Daemon is probably the only character that could be in the same room with Tyrion, Jamie etc. But I still find the House of the Dragon characters to be minimally interesting, or else why do I not care about what is at stake for them?"
"Watched through: 2 Episodes.Is it GoT so, I'll watch it just because but, it is extremely lackluster so far. It's all dark and brooding and melancholy and dreary.... GoT was those things also but, not only those things. All of the moments of levity and charisma and vibrancy are just completely stripped away. I have no particular fondness for any characters. Daemon Targaryen seems like they want him to be kind of a cross between Little Finger and Jaime but, the former Doctor Who falls flat thus far, lacking charm of any kind.It not TERRIBLY but, it's definitely not great either. I'm sure some people will keep putting 10s because ""it's GoT"" and ""there's dragons"" but, aside from young people walking around with white hair and some dragons, it doesn't feel much like GoT."
"It's just flat. The characters are boring. Dialogs are flat and predictable. Costumes and sets are conceived in a universe of greys and browns and beige. Who cares of a dynasty of spoiled incestuous idiots with white wigs and a fake British accent? Come on!!! Fantasy means imagination, this is trite dog food with a huge budget, counting on the millions of people around the globe who appreciated Game of Thrones. In GOT the photography was lush and, at least sometimes a scenery was attracting the eye. Here all looks fake and flat on those grey cliffs. And the actors are so stiff, rigid, it looks as exciting as a chess game played by two beginners. Null."
"That's it, that's all..."
"This show only exist thanks to her and end was disaster...So, this looks like cheap way of making things right. Everything is just a reminder how bad season 8 was."
"This was literally the worst most hopeless most overhyped most disappointing show in the history of the world. The acting is third class, the plot is clueless, the direction in all senses is a disaster. Million times better to just watch reruns of GOT or Friends or just the corner of your kitchen than to watch this masterful catastrophe of a series.After all the looking forward to it and all the high expectations, this was the biggest come down of it all. Recommend the director to find a new profession and for the actors to go to the corner of their kitchen and hang their head in utter and abject shame."
I only watch the whole 10 episodes because of GOT and this one is nowhere near the original.Most of the show shot in kings landing in comparison of various locations of GOT.Only main plot is succession in a house and does not involve other houses. This doesn't get you more than one season (and gets boring after 5 episodes).The king has chosen the most corrupted man in Westeros and to top that marries his daughter!The Driftmark and Valyrians are just there for diversity and marriage proposals.There is no character development and so many babies with similar names you cant remember!There is a dragon that can expel faeces just as big as a fully grown dragon!And so many plot holes that i forgot just like the whole show after two days of finishing it.
"What an absolute pointless bore of a feast this is.What is the point? Trying to live in the shadows of Games of Thrones? Well this is a total failure, it stinks. If you suffer from insomnia then I suggest try watching this as it will put you to sleep, 100% guarantee.For a few episodes you are watching one group of actors then suddenly in episode 5 or 6 they suddenly change and become a lot older while others stay the same, that is how daft it is.You get some dragons and bit of soft porn to stop you completely falling asleep and that is a good as it gets. I think I'll watch some Dr Who instead, even that mumbo jumbo beats this."
Music reused from GOT
It's trying very jard to be a GOT but without any good acting poor CGI and low budget score. Too bad. Hopes it get better this is nothing more than fan fiction that should be on youtube not HBO.
"Nothing unexpected. Brutal scenes. Sex. Dragons. If you want more of that then I guess this is for you.I like interesting characters, I just see tired GoT archetypes. It's like watching a cheap documentary explanation for House Targaryen.Prolonged scenes of gore. That don't impress me much."
"I have never seen Game of Thrones, so I don't have any of the backstory.I was truly amazed by this cinematic titanic. But not in a good way.This didn't click for me. The plot was predictable from the outset.There really was nothing new here. But as I got into it, I began to notice"
things. First was the use of F-bombs. Seriously? It was then that I looked
"at the rating. TV-MA. Hmm. Gratuitous sex. No thanks. I don't need that.This could have been easily re-editted without loosing the ahem, story-line, and making this a PG-13 family epic. But apparently it was not meant to entertain families.The acting was very pedestrian. Nothing stands out here. There was a complete lack of chemistry between the actors. Were these supposed to be family members?The acting was so out-of-whack, it didn't really enhance or carry the story line"
"whatsoever. Compare that with say Downton Abbey which had tremendous chemistry.The characters came alive. Sadly, this was glaring in House of the Dragon.On a positive note though, the costuming and CGI graphics (for $20 million an"
"episode it ought to be) were second-to-none.I will watch one more episode to confirm my feelings, but I think it will confirm"
what I have already experienced.Wayno.
"It's so basic I want to cry. The main plot is ""Princess doesn't like responsibility"" and two episodes are given to the queen trying to find out if the princess is still a virgin or nah. So.. not very exciting.What really kills it for me is the time hops though. 2 years later, 6 years later, 10 years later. Etc. And what's worse is all these time hops show little progress from our starting point.Bottom line is that for a fantasy, this shows an exceptional lack of imagination. I don't need new concepts every time I watch something new, but IF you're going to feed us the same old porridge, at least heat it up a little."
"Another bad HBO max show.I got very bored. The series is boring and has many things that are already seen in many other series. Repetitive and boring, then the CGI is of low quality."
"Every episode is getting worse. Horrible cgi,story line sucks,acting could be done better with 8th graders in a play...very disappointing..The acting is laughable. I could of picked up a bunch of neighborhood kids,dressed them up and wore a dragon costume and sent the script to hbo ...oh wait..someone apparently has already done that..It's called House of the dragon. They shouldn't be allowed to even associate this game of thrones. Im watching episode 4 as I write this.. I could barely finish episode 3 after the girl started splashing pig blood all over her face...it had to be the stupidest scene I've seen so far. I honestly looked so forward to seeing this and it's a lemon..and no,I'm not making lemonade with it..lol."
"The series premiere feels exactly like a GRRM blog journal entry. There are certainly a lot of ideas, but nothing particularly clear or interesting unless you are 100% entrenched in and knowledgeable of his work.I had to watch an hour long video on YouTube that explained the politics and the bloodlines to figure out what what going on in the premiere.There is a lot of debauchery, violence and gore; however, all of it was unnecessary and failed to drive the plot. If these aspects are what show runners think fans loved about GOT, they are woefully mistaken.After reading HOTD, I can't say that I'd be willing to invest any time into WATCHING this series. There are many who love the storyline of HOTD. I'm not one of them.I feel that the show runners know that the series premiere is distractedly terrible, which is why they gave the series sneak peek that they did. Perhaps, this show can turn around, but for now, I cannot say that I would recommend this show to anyone."
"I really tried to give this show a chance. Watched the whole first season just to end up so disappointed. GOT gave you so many characters to root for early one- both good and bad. I could care less if any of these characters die. In fact, I hope they all die, and we get a new storyline with new characters. Wanted to love this series so much. Gave it every chance to get better. The multiple time jumps and character changes were both distracting and really killed the flow of the series. The ten episodes felt like different shows. I would not recommend this series. I would rather watch GOT over and again before watching this series one other time."
"They should have named it ""House of the dra-ma"".I really tried to find an interest in that new exciting tv show except i couldn't find any engaging storyline (i really loved GOT, except last few episodes of S08) and since we're comparing those two i would definitely recommend TROP over HBO's new GOT meets Bridgerton tv show.Everything is cheesy, and boring. What happened in this almost coming to an end first season really ?Feels like a very cheep version of GOT. At some point characters (mostly women) are aging and some other don't! I felt scamed and i said to myself ""did they really spoiled the end of GOT to go produce this junk""Skip that one - you don't miss anything."
"This shows plot seems like the secondary story of a show rather than the primary one. Idc about the family drama, and the show is 80% family drama. ""Boo hoo I don't wanna get married, I'm a rebel"", sums up the main character. The king seems like the only likable character and he's kind of boring. I've watched 5 episodes and feel no compulsion to watch more. There needs to be a wider story arc that's more about the world than there is. They touch on other things but they don't really go very deep, it's more of just an excuse for one of the characters to do something predictable. I don't expect it to match GoT quality, but so far it's not even close."
"The idea of telling the story of the house of the dragons appealed much to me as I was absolutely amazed by Game of Thrones and the precise chronologic order and characters growing in within the years. This here seems to me more like a hastily thrown together story without regard to the physiognomic appearance details of the important characters. You skip years, from sequel to sequel. The actors have nothing in common, especially in appearance and also in mimics with the previous ones. You start out wondering who you are actually seeing and then comes the disappointment of discovering a ""princess"" who seems completely uncharacteristic and banal. One should perhaps take the example of the series ""DARK"" in which all characters as well as children, adolescents and adults allow equal, directly identifiable recognition. So for my part a packet of minus points. Not a collectible."
Forgettable characters.Forgettable acting.Forgettable writing.Forgettable storyline.This is NOT even close to the quality of Game of Thrones.5 minutes after watching an episode i can barely tell you what happened.If you are a fan of Game of Thrones i cant see how you wont be very disappointed in this series.OMG now i have to come up with a bunch more words to satisfy some arbitrary and unnecessary 600 character quota on reviews.The dragons seem nice. I would like to have one but my condo has a strict No Dragons policy.And now i am close to the end of this review and i rejoice.
"Hollywood didn't think it needed doing it anymore. Even if the series is a cheap imitation of ""Game of Thrones"", feat. Dangerously deluded and narcissistic main role protagonists. Just pair near children with old men, create a set the cost of which could feed the whole of Sudan and insinuate to everyone that this is such a good story. And it works. The grandeur, the lavishness, the incessant narcissism of the main protagonist. This product is given to children and adolescents, making them believe hebephilia on a grand scale is normal. Insinuating that self obsession is something to strive for. I am absolutely disgusted and very worried."
"As a lot of fans, I eagerly awaited the new HBO product, and the disappointment was momentous: 3 years of silence to come out, in a climate of great expectation, with such a story really leaves one perplexed and disappointed.After the first two episodes, slow but quite interesting, nothing works: the plot is poor and revolves around incoherent characters.GoT had delivered a spectacular beginning that immediately started with action and then warped a rich plot of power and intrigue.This House of Dragons moves awkwardly, unconvincing in its events and predictable plots, bad copies of GoT.The casting choices are questionable to say the least, as is the script, which seems to be written by different people who, let's face it, don't even know the craft of writing very well.There is no sex, no intrigue, no character to get attached to and one to hate. In short, the series is tepid, tasteless soup aping GoT.The characters are all poised as if waiting for something to come into action, something that never comes: an ""interrupted coitus"" of acting.They look like pawns on a chessboard forgotten in the attic. Every episode of House of the Dragon is a wait for something that does not come, every episode finale is a landing in a grey desert.Kudos to HBO: if you wanted to destroy a myth, you have succeeded with extraordinary efficiency."
This show was deeply flawed in many ways and doesn't deserve this high score. Very little redeems this show.The time jump was the biggest problem causing their already awful casting decisions to get worse. Millie Alcock was amazing in this show but her replacement was very poor. Matt Smith was a bad casting choice with his awful shrill voice.There were numerous practical and CG effect gaffs ranging from them forgetting to painting out green fingers to awful dragon heads.Episodes were way too long and the was an awful lack of action. Barely any dragon featured in the show.It was as poor as the final season of GOT.
"I give points only for amazing cast for first the Rhaenyea, for Daemon and for Dragons. The rest is an absolute miss. Bad costumes, generic music, everything is green screen, poor dialogues and not in sync with the time, bad acting from most of the cast, dissapointing choice of directing, completely turning the story into some family drama, dissmissing the entire world around the Targeryans, shallow scenes, unexplained actions from characters, rushed, results without a cause, poor character development... People have lost sense for quality tv, and would hype anything with a bit of drama&sex&incest. Dissapointing."
"Eight episodes in and I give up. Did you love the excitement, chocking twists, the amazing characters and bombastic scenes in Game of thrones? Well, there's nothing of that in here. But if you like a costume drama with dragons, lots of pointless dialogue and a plot that never seems to take off. Then this is for you!Of course one must compare it with Game of thrones! Who would ever care about this if it wasn't for Game of thrones? As other users already staded in their reviews, it seems like the producers wants a long runner. Maybe it starts off for real at season 3 or so. But there are too many good series to watch instead of this. So there won't be any viewers left by season 3."
"I absolutely loved the Game of Thrones series and honestly had high hopes for the House of Dragons prequel. I know that this is done by different writers and I approached the new series with an open mind. That being said, I can't believe that a big budget series has such horrible writing and only shadows of character development. There are several good actors in the cast, but they are all shackled by the horrible dialogue and poor excuse for a story. The only redeeming quality of the series is the special effects of the dragons themselves. It seems that more emphasis was placed on the eye candy and the story was an after thought. I kept hoping that the story would improve with each episode, but I have been sadly disappointed and there's not one character in the series that I care about.I'm going to bail out on this series and go back to watching the original Game of Thrones."
"Don't WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!What is a TV Show without good Actors?A Documentary or Game of Thrones - House of the Dragon!I get it, the best ones died on the original Game of Thrones TV Show and they couldn't revive them but REALLY? NOBODY? From Hollywood wanted to play in this TV Show? I don't get that!The characters just look fake and can't really act, the story is boring, there is no action and even the costumes look fake. I was even able to predict what would happen in episode 2 without watching any trailer. I was used to be surprised but this one even fails at surprising me.After Episode 2 I'm not really thinking about watching the whole Season.It's funny that HBO cancelled so many TV Shows but this one is coming through."
"Has everyone forgotten about GoT! Everything was great about it: acting, story, longevity but this show is aweful! Won t watch season 2. I believe this series is only a money grab! No real artistic value! It contains poor acting, story is so cliche, the production is visibly cheap - they only throw in some dragone scences and that's it! How's that supposed to make a series?I also think Mr. Martin didn't right it. He's just ""consulted"" as he says. Just imagine this series had no link to the famous Game if Thrones. Noone would have watched it! No one! I don't recommend this to anyone! Don't waste your time!"
"What a waste of time and money. Dreadfully boring soap opera. They had a whole season and they've spent all their screen time bickering about who'll take the throne, who will marry who and crying on the bench about irrelevant bullsht. Dr who guy is the only memorable character and is basically carrying the whole show with his acting. Him and the other dude with the eyepatch and white hair. The rest are more annoying then jefrey from game of thrones. Ugh i cant stand this. 0 rewatch value. Infact it makes me cringe just remembering the lame scenes. Every time i finish an episode i ask my self why have i wasted my time again falling for the hope that it might be interesting. No more. You had your chance and you wasted it."
...boring and disgusting in that order. I endured the violence of the fist series because I was invested in the compassionate characters. 34 min in and I'm forcing myself to find some redeeming characteristic to keep watching....little or no character development nor location/atmosphere/environment development...simple lighting that does little for set design or costumes...no flair no flavor.No interesting or handsome young men with strong onscreen presence (or women for that matter) luring me to keep watching although Steve Toussaint (Lord Corlys) is the only reason I watched in the first place. Flat performances...just pales in comparison to the first series.
"If this is the reason the last two seasons of GoT to be rushed through... must say I expected some kind of a miracle. Instead, I watched 3 women giving birth 4 times, 3 dragons flying backwards and forwards, and every episode shows a different timing from the previous. Domestic drama and soap opera, with some actors not adding anything additional to the main idea of the series. Lots of unnecessary scenes. One of them is the prince Aegon on his balcony doing... well, watch it. Don't understand from where is this high rating as most of the comments by other viewers are negative. Very disappointed."
"Unfortunately, this season was a show about nothing. That's the real reason there isn't a second season lined up right away.The rest of the text that I'm about to write is because there is a requirement of so many characters that have to be written. So many required characters that I feel like I'm one of the writers for the show, and will detail some insignificant plot twist over the course of five episodes. It's too bad George RR Martin wasn't able to keep pace with the script writers. Here's to hoping for a better second season in 2 years. Alas, this feels like a college paper where you BS 75% in order to meet the professor's requirements, even though you could have summed it up in three sentences."
Everyone in the series ages about 15-20 years before the last episode except Criston and Daemon. They both stay in the their early 20's. All the plastic surgeons in the world couldn't achieve that miracle. Leans to the soapy side. The show reveals how the monarchy is embedded into every English-born citizen's brain in real life. The self-absorbed and entitled disposition of royalty was too much to stomach. This is the end of review. IMDB requires that I type 200 more characters before they will accept it so I'm going to do just that. It's not a difficult thing to do but it seems like a waste of time since the whole of what I wanted to say has already been written.
"BORING, BORING, BORING, talking heads, horrible writing, directing, no close ups, you cannot connect with any of these people, you don't care what happens to them. Needs way more dragons, No real plot. Matt Smith was the only interesting person, and you turned his role into almost nothing.he is the star of the show and is barely in it.!!!! Where is the ACTION? Where are the pretty girls and great sex scenes? What was shown was a WASTE of talent. Lets see some women with some real meaty roles Let me write and direct a few episodes. FIRE THE DIRECTORS, WRITERS, CASTING DIRECTOR, EVERYONE AND START OVER!"
"I'm a big fan of GoT, and I am trying to like this show, but I actually don't even understand the such high rating here.As one other reviewer put it, this is literally like a soap opera. It's just endless talking and drama inside a dark castle, or briefing outside in the gloomy and foggy weather. The only action or conflict we had was the Crab Eater guy, who was intriguing at first, but they ended that ""years long war"" with a silly single day battle and a completely anticlimactic killing of their leader.In GoT there were many different characters and plotlines going on all the time, so it was easier to find characters you really liked, or hated. In HotD, there's not a single character that I have any sort of elevated emotion for, and especially less-so since the character/actor change for the time jump.Overall, it's just a single, dark, boring, soap-opera-esque plotline that has failed to make me invested."
"I'm not sure if these streaming services are run by Actual people anymore. I'm convinced it's the MCP computer head from Tron giving orders through an algorithm.I wont even remember this show next year.The male actors really stink here. This show opens up with a sequence so boring, so uninteresting I was shocked. The exact opposite of the great opening in Game Of Thrones, this was a major snooze. And the talentless, boring men playing the lead parts are close to unwatchable. The Prince in particular is a really tedious, uninteresting actor. There is no action, the plot seems to not exist, the dragons loo made of silicone, and the story as I can follow it is just tedious. How on earth this gets a 9 is beyond me. People are suspicious of the 1 ratings. I am not. So far, this story about princes and princesses in a golden kingdom is a snooze, and a poorly acted one at that. After all the hype what I see is nothing."
"I really wanted to love this as much as I loved GoT vut in every way - except for the music - it's a poorer cousin. Sadly, all of the characters are either unlikable or insipid, and the casting involves choosing faces that are just so slappable and annoying. I'm rooting for the dragons to take them all out in a giant but unremarkable furnace. The older Rhaenya is lovely as is the first leader of the Queens Guard. Maybe the dragons could kindly spare them? It lacks the lustre and film quality of GoT, the special effects are not really special. It's a GoT wannabe done on a low budget. I am disappointed and I really wanted to love this. Drat!!"
"No story. No plot. Characters switch every episode. Screen time goes to insignificant events that are boring and seem to all go back to a fetish. Feet. Sex. Etc. This is not GoT... A few flying lizards and the Targ. Name is pretty much the only similar qualities. So we had 10 episodes of straight trash, bad acting and terrible story telling. Let's see how many babies die in each episode next season. For some reason they need to replicate still births. Like the audience can't understand what that is. So let's waste 20 minutes of two episodes on it. THIS IS GARBAGE. This is not game of thrones. It's basically a bad soap opera with a very big budget. I don't even understand why ANYONE would ok this show for a second season."
"Tired of diversity quotas ruining what would otherwise be a great show. Their nonsensical casting choice for House Valeryon ruined the show. I can't wrap my head around such a stupid decision. It's like writing a spin off story about ancient families in wakanda and one of the tribes being blonde white people. There are far too many complications to the story as a result. For one it'd be incredibly obvious Rhaenyra's children are ""bastards"". Not to mention they're related to Targaryens so they're the last house of people that should have been casted as black.The Targaryen casting is perfect on the other hand. I love Daemon and adult Aemond Targaryen. Generally the first half of the story told felt rushed, where almost all important interactions and confrontations were abruptly transitioned.I would have given the show an 8 but the terrible casting decision behind house Valeryon makes me role my eyes everytime they appear on the screen."
"Game of thrones was one of my favourite all time TV shows. It took me a while to try and watch it as I'm not into fantasy or fighting TV shows normally... but wow! What characters! What script writing! What a plot! It was such a package that it had me hooked by the end of the first few episodes.House of dragon's characters are weak, uninteresting and shallow. The plot is equally poor. Most of it has all been told before and better in Game of thrones. There is no one that I care enough about for the outcome to matter at all.This is a disappointing spin off that seems to be financially motivated."
"So far i have found it a bit slow, even comparing to the the game of thrones pilot episode was more interesting than this, the acting and writing get better i hope but for now it is boring.I will edit this review as the show progresses."
"Don't know what were the makers of this thinking? Were they saving bucks. There are no scenes where you can feel the rush, excitement and enjoyment and what you get is just story which is fairly predictable if you see it closely. Expectations after GOT are huge. I wait whole week just to get a show which I will have to forward and finish it in half a time to skip the boring talking stuff among the cast. Only, Daemon had everything to give this season a thrilling scenes. I still believe showing just dragon won't give audience the the peak thrill. Expectations was huge from GOT, which is just not met."
"I find myself actually really enjoying this programme, the u fortunate thing is that every other episode you've had a time jump - and I'm not talking 6 months or a year I'm talking 6 years, significant time jumps that have actors and actresses changing out for older ones.It just feels so rushed, but deaths or pivotal plot points are few per episode that none of it really hits too hard. If they took it slower, focussed on quality we would be able to feel for these characters much more and have stronger reactions.It's like GOT on triple speed, not sure but if I have any feedback for the show creators for season 2 onwards. Slow it down and take your time."
"Well, out of curiosity I decided to give this show a chance. And compared to other series launched this year, it's at least watchable. But in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king.It's really difficult to make a prequel of GoT, considering everybody knows how it's going to end, also taking into account the last 2 seasons, which were extremely disappointing, especially the ending.THE CONS of this show"
"the story is just not so great. And it's basically the middle of the Targaryen history. And actually none of the characters has any redeeming quality, they all wicked in a way.the pacing, it s either too slow or it s too fast forwardthe dialogue between the characters it's dull. Sometimes it feels more like a soap opera.the sex scenes (and yes I have to mention this, beacuse the erotic component it's an important part, and gives more credibility to the story.)the political agenda, is yet again pushed down in this MEDIEVAL FANTASY show.an probably the thing that annoys me the most is that every single goddammed episode had half of it s scenes filmed in the dark, and you are basically struggling to understand what is happening.THE PROS"
"for what thet were given to do, the actors are doing a pretty good job.-the costumes are well made"
"and despite the people say the dragons are not well made, I really think they are ok."
"I felt the need to write a review after watching episode 6. What... happened?The first episodes looked very promising, they were building the characters, introducing the plot and story. Yet somehow, from episode 5 to 6 we get a 10+ years jump. Apparently they thought it was a good idea to recast some of the main characters, yet leave others as if time hadn't passed for some? They kept the same actors for Daemon and Sr Criston, looking exactly as they were before. Truly seemed like a strange decision, and quite disappointing. Milly Alcock does a far better job at acting as Rhaenyra than Emma D'Arcy.GOT did this so well. It focused on creating this connection to the story as well as the characters. Now... House of Dragon: Why such a rush? Seems like they could have explored the story so much more. What a missed opportunity, and quite a shame."
"It was all great til eps 5, I watched the rest with interest, but I wasn't as invested. It all got a bit silly in eps 6 and continued after that. Larys is a pointless character, and his scheming is incomprehensible to me. He reminds me of Littlefinger, but without the subtleties. The book explains the motivations of the characters and reconciles the good and bad, but the TV series fails to engage with the personalities and paints too sharply in black and white. The time skips don't work smoothly either, and I found that aspect a bit jarring. Most of the acting is top notch, but I personally have never seen Matt Smith as a serious actor, and that spoiled every scene he was in, in my opinion."
Most of the performances are fine if not good. The pacing and the script have a deep sickness that I doubt can be cured. The plot points and characters are fine and some of them are very interesting but everything is so rushed along that I can't care about any of it and the stuff I would like to care about isn't set up at all and just thrown in like they forgot they needed continued conflict. Way too many of the scenes are characters saying the same thing over and over in different locations like the show only has one thing to say. The original series also gripped people with immersion from set design and made the world feel lived in but from the first episode all the props and set pieces look so new and clean like they just came off an Amazon truck. Nothing is dirty or looks at all used or lived in. This is a minor gripe compared to the complete mess of the script. It's so horrendously bad I can't believe no one else seems to see this.
"This new series pales in comparison to its prediscesor. I cannot believe why it is actually popular. It can't really be so well loved by actual Martin fans. It is now just a British soap opera with the odd dragon. Each episode drags on slower and worse than the previous. The amount of money they have spent and the actors involved would suppose this series a success, but no, it is truly terrible. Downton Abbey is more exciting. The last season of Game of Thrones was the worst, but it isn't anymore. If you are a true GOT fan please let the world know of how much you detest this new series. Jon Snow would want you too."
"What a huge disappointment after GOT! This is a hot mess. The script is terrible. The lighting is dark and it is hard to see what is happening. I feel sorry for the actors who have to learn such lousy lines. The costumes are well done. The settings are interesting. But the writing is terrible. The story drags and drags and drags along. The characters are not interesting, and it is hard to feel anything positive about any of them. Basically, they are selfish, self-centered narcissistic creeps. Absolutely absorbed with power and control. Do not waste your time with this hot mess. It sucks. Really sucks."
"For me its boring. Its more for kids. Poor plot, dont like the acting. Watch 1 or 2 episode and you will see. No more than 5 stars for me. Hope for better upcoming episodes. Too much ""the unbeaten hero"" actions. You are wondering what is happening, but not in the good way. Literally no story. Poor action scenes. Nothing engaging on the screen. I think that they just rushed to make the show. And Just don't belive the stars 8.8 of 10, and when you look at the comments you are wondering ""how?"". In my opininon GOT is much much better. Im sure that they wanted HOD to be better than GOT but they Just overplayed the scenes."
"The overall feeling of epic levels of MEH make this prequel hopelessly frustrating to slog through viewing. I don't know why I bother. Please help me stop watching this, I can't even see the poorly lit rooms, revised to fit the queen's new religion, which according to the postscript exposition in episode 8, was apparently meaningful. And yes, I checked my tv settings after last week, which was more interesting for its night shoots.There's just nothing to invest interest in, despite the cast, and Paddy Considine's anguished King Lear homage. Just nothing. So whenever this series tries to have an epic climax, there just will be no point. I'm going back to my place in the Douglas Addams universe."
"I couldn't make it past the first 20 pages of the book without dying of boredom before giving up on it, but the first season of this series looked very promising so I made the mistake of committing myself to it.The story is incredibly weak, the acting is weak, the politics is weak, and the dialogue is weak.They keep fast forwarding the story by months and years at a time in between episodes without even having the courtesy to tell you how much time has actually elapsed since the previous piece of trash episode, and in episode 6, they fast forward the story so much that they have to replace half the actors with older ones just as you've become used to them.George R. R. Martin struck it lucky with Game of Thrones, and the books that he never finished are the only good books he ever wrote. Everything else he wrote is absolute garbage and he clearly hasn't finished the books that were good because he knows that he will serve them a gross injustice. He should seriously go into retirement now instead of wasting our valuable time exposing us to this garbage he is creating lately."
"At the very least I expected CGI that lived up to the original series. Nope. The special effects were on the SyFy channel level, as was just about everything else about this cash grab. From the first moment of GoT, you knew you were watching something special. Even the opening credits were a wonder. This tiresome soap opera offered nothing of the sort. We couldn't even sit through the first episode, which I've subsequently read tries to make up for poor storytelling with over the top gore. This series, far from redeeming the atrocious final season of GoT, makes even those final blunders seem worth revisiting. Hard pass."
"I wasn't expecting GOT, as a reader of GRRM I was still impressed with GOT because they took the time to make it 'real'. I didn't expect House of Dragons to be GOT as it came before Aegon the Conqueror (Fire and Blood) HOD has as many and more complex characters as GOT. If Amazon can spend over $80 million an episode for LOTR's Rings of Power, why is HBO cheating us? It's not just the bad acting, fake wigs, or the bad CGI (the dragons are cool); but they started in the middle of the story!! I feel cheated because they're not telling the WHOLE story. Aegon the Conqueror married 2 of his sisters and thus began the Targaryen Dynasty. They don't explain that the Velaryon's (as in Corlys) are close blood relations to the Family before they left Valeria or explain 'The Doom of Valeria' Spend some money HBO!! You have it!"
"Ok, they make you write six hundred characters which is ridiculous so bare with me. But if you want real reviews it's what you must deal withIf you are watching house of the dragon you more than likely were a game of thrones fan. I agree with others that there is no comparison.It's as if since Covid they forgot what GOT was about or how to continue making the hit we grew to love. Agree with others this seemed rushed, almost as if let's get through this we are not making any more. At least it is what it seems.The young characters were terrific and it started like ok, then like WTF happened. It really has been rushed.It could have been much better and drags along way to much. With only a couple of episodes with war, fighting and dragon's lol. If they spent as much time and detail and building characters and telling the story as they did playing with sand model it would be better lol.Daemon character should have played much bigger roll. I mean seriously, the guy would have just crushed his brother lol, who apparently can't command or fly dragons lol.It is worth watching but if you go in expecting the same standard as GOT you will be disappointed.Bring more fighting, more dragons, sex, rock n roll yada yada. When you hear that iconic opening music you have expectations.Hopefully it will renew and they will get their act, pun intended, together."
"Let me start by saying that this series is for no one. It's disgusting when it comes to sexual scenery and trying to enforce some ideas and messages into straight minds, too violent for kids and soft heart but at the same time it became kinda childish in Episode 6 with kids and dragons. I felt like Im watching Train your Dragon. So if we exclude straight minds, kids, soft heart, who is this series made for?Changing charachrers in Episode 6 was one of the biggest mistakes and that's where I stopped watching this series. Story wise, just same as any royal story who are fighting for a throne, I don't see really much story in the outer world.Last thing, in Game of Thrones we were waiting the whole season to see the dragon once. On the contrary in House of the Dragon it became so boring seeing them many times in every episode.Again, my opinion that this series has nothing to add other than more violence, more ubnormality in sexual scenery, more dragons."
"Scenery and costumes are still to a high standard, similar to GoT, but the actors, storylines and intrigue is so much less than the orginal GoT. The actors look like puppets, there is hardly any expression and seem to be going through the motions. I don't feel any connection with any of them, the storyline doesn't make it easy either with nothing special happening where the viewer could get excited about no small scenes to built those emotional connections that were plentiful in GoT and the pretty much total lack of intrigue and plotting against each other, too little strong contenders for the throne that get actually developed. So all in all, very disappointing, even coming down from the last season of GoT. HoD is picking up later in the season, episodes 7-9 are a bit better, but too little and too late."
"How are they getting to show this drivel. Bolder than GOT. Are thy on something, acting is shocking, are all these people with the high reviews related to the cast or production ðŸ¤” Sorry very boring. Just poor.No characters are capable of grabbing my attention. It's a c series not even b of GOT.Hopefully season 2 will have got rid of the plastic actors and invest on better actors and producers.This is well over hyped. Really sorry just don't care if its on or not.I was so wanting to like this show but can't get the point or feel for any of the characters who have just came off a soap series."
"It is interesting to me that, like GOT, we are delivered a wealth of naked women, non-missionary love making, etc, to try to keep fans interested. Professional women, three ways, etc I'm not a prude by any stretch, and maybe because I just finished binge watching GOT, but this is so much like the other. I may watch later but this is not cutting it. I wonder if a female dominated production staff would write it this way? Very demeaning for a lot of women in it. And now I have to add more useless communication like the show because of the need for 600 characters!!It also seems there is some control over content. Guess I cannot use the w word! Or maybe the s word? How odd!!"
"First off I apologize if I seem misinformed regarding the history of GoT and how eventful this storyline may become as I have not read the books and have only watched the HBO series. However, watching this version of GoT constantly makes me think is there not a more interesting storyline that could be told other than the power struggle between a pouting teenager and sulking brother? Given how much this is costing, wouldn't HBO want to engage the viewer with the Doom of Valyria or the conquering of Westeros? Heck, I'd even take the downfall of the Mad King at this point.I understand that there is the constant woke pressure in Hollywood, but can we not just produce/write one good show that both makes sense, is interesting, and tells a logical unforced story."
"I'm reading the book this is supposed to be taken from, Fire and Blood, and I recognize nothing but a few names and dragons between the 2. Even the timeline is completely off.Nor is it even the same story, I wish they had done RR Martin's version, it is SO much better. It flows, it has a story and likeable, recognizable and emotion inducing characters. The tv show has none of it. Even their names have been mostly changed, it's very strange. I don't get the obsession with Daenerys, either. RR Martin's timeline is 300 years prior to the batch of Lannisters, Starks and Baratheons we were introduced to, but this show is touting some crap about 170+ years before Daenerys. The show sullied her character before they ended the last series, with that horrifically out of character actions she ended up deciding on, so why is she even in this? Even the theme music is played, like she hadn't been born yet. Can they not sell the show without her name?This is a sorry interpretation of the book, as I said. I wanted to like it, but I cannot. I like the dragons, though, they seem to have all the personality in this incarnations of the GoT universe. I'm not going to rehash the actual meandering, yet simple storyline, weak acting, etc., because many have already done so before me and they're much better at it than I. If you watch it, don't expect much.I cannot imagine RR Martin is impressed with the butchery of his works."
"We really fell in love with this series. Then we found episode 6 where we lose our main character rheanyra to some new replacement actor who is different and several others were replaced. Was a totally different show. Why would any director ever do that?? It was never the same and we did not continue past E7. Huge let down... I Just can't believe they did this kind of thing to us all over again with this new series... makes me wonder how many others feel the same and haven't found a way to share the concern.Then there was a huge lack of dragon action. Rarely did we get to see exactly what dragons gave them which is different than other competing communities.Honestly, we might just avoid future series shows by HBO as there has been other let downs unfortunately.Anyone else considering to drop MAX or is there anything incoming to be excited about?"
"Pure disappointment. I watched the whole season just to see if it would get any better, but no chance!The quality of the script and storyline is very low compared to GOT. And people shouldn't say it shouldn't be compared. HOD is the backstory of GoT and of course they try to sell it as such. But the plot feels like some cheap gossip! The characters are introduced as something else and act completely out of character!Fortunately, there is no 2nd season yet and they have time to change the storyline if they really want to make it popular!With the same pace and plot flow, it's a big NO for me."
"I will start with that from the start I was not into the first episode at all. The characters unbelievable because the actors seem miscast. Paddy considine is a fine actor, but not for this part. The production and HBO obviously sink millions of dollars into the series so there's no issue on that aspect. I just found it too similar to GOT as far as the plot. The wigs as well, OMG lol. Obviously many have noticed that from the reviews. I was very bored and actually fell asleep 2 times trying to finish the first episode. I will give it a chance and hope I warm up to it or it actually gets better. Just because it's a GOT story doesn't mean it's necessarily good or great. The 10 star reviews are mostly bogus as usual."
"My expectations were so low...Anyway, my rating is mostly based on the comparison between the first episode of GoT and this one and this is quite bad in comparison."
"I really like this show and I understand they have to keep it realistic, but when the movie is dark and you can't see anything, it doesn't matter how realistic it is.I would have like more candles or touches, so I could see what's going on rather than a black or a very dark background.screen.I hope it future episodes you will condider more lighting.The other episodes were great. However I miss seeing sone of the characters when you guys jumped ahead ten years. That was a long time to jump ahead, but I understand this is a long story and you had no choice. Keep up the good work, but please a bit brighter backgrounds."
Charmless episode and boring ... i was disappointed

"I really wanted to like this. GOT is my favorite TV series of all time. I am even one that read the books back when they came out and thought that HBO did an excellent job of converting them to a visual masterpiece. I love dark fantasy books, movies, and tv shows. For the record I have not read the HOTD series.I watched HOTD a few times to make sure, buts it's just not for me. No offense to any one that enjoys it. I think HOTD, like many shows, suffers from its own success, (or in this case it's predecessor). A lot of shows decline in later seasons as they become popular. Too many hands in the pot making and writing it. No singular vision. The love and creativity gets lost in trying to please fans and political agendas. Too many themes, build ups, and pandering ideas need to be included in HOTD and it's ugly. No comprehendible story line, unlikable characters, bad acting, and a closed world that seems small in comparison to the original. Mostly just a dark dreary castle with people talking.GOT had a lot of story lines going with different villains and heros, different locations and landscapes that all hovered around the same theme. IMO HOTD overuses cgi and it seems obvious which takes me out of the story.If the original never existed, I wouldn't even had made it through all the episodes.In the GOT, the plot jumped between character perspectives and arcs, weaving in and out of each others stories building towards confrontation.always something new and the characters were interesting and you like them (or loved to hate them), HOTD characters are just too shallow and uncomplicated. This is one long boring political storyline. Cookie cutter trope characters with no depth. The politics in GOT added the story and contributed to the action, in HOTD the politics are the story, the action, sex, and crappy CGI seem tacked on. Seems they add the violence and sex to keep it from being just people talking but that falls flat without the viewer being invested in the character. Some might enjoy the political part of the GOT universe, I don't. Just can't keep interested. The acting is basic and I think that some actors just expected it to be a success and phoned it in. In addition, the time jump and change of characters was a mess. What little interest I had for the characters was lost with the time jump.I am sure there are fans of this show, and I am thankful for them. Hopefully there are enough fans of this to keep GOT alive for another (better) spin off. But I usually am pretty good barometer representing the average person that watches this type of content and, if so, HOTD is not doing well in the viewership. I really hope they just wrap this and come up with a different spin off similar to the original. But probably not, GOT was a unique and risky investment that happened to pay off. HBO and American entertainment in general just doesn't take risks anymore, they just push agendas and just can't make a movie anymore without politics and pandering. Good writing and acting will always sell. Mediocre writing and acting will give you mediocre ratings."
"Game of Thrones was unique because it was edgy with original characters and a storyline that kept you captivated and anticipating the next development in the plot. This unfortunate reimagining lacks all of that and immediately bogs one down in the slow plodding character development of an array of two dimensional very similar personalities. The cast of characters are all boringly the same, namely pretentious, self important and tediously predictable. Why the writers would possibly think that the endless, trivial conversations that are part of the first two episodes would constitute a form of interesting character development or even entertainment is beyond me. It demonstrates an abject lack of writing skill, or more likely a cowardly reliance on the formulaic rather than daring to create something truly original. We can only hope that like the original GOT characters will start to get killed off, and preferably the greater majority of them."
"Let me start by saying GOT was a fantastic series so had very high hopes for this and did it disappoint.....quite simply yes, yes it did disappoint it was absolutely terrible, poor casting and felt nothing like GOT it was more like Alice in wonderland with a few dragons thrown in! It was so boring pretty much watching people sit around a table talking and an angry jealous brother trying to act hard. There was absolutely nothing good to take from this first episode hopefully it picks up but don't hold your breath."
"So disappointed, truly just a horrible hodge podge of terrible casting and unnecessary gore, that does nothing to further the story. I cannot even imagine trying to sit through another episode. The casting fails and makes it very hard to take anything seriously. I did not come into this show expecting it to be GOT 2.0 which is good thing because this show desperately tries for that but fails. I really really wanted to fall hard for this but it just falls short. No connection to the characters left me not caring what happens next. The only good thing is the DRAGONS! Sad ðŸ˜­Apparently I can say what I needed to in few words but I have to have 600 so I guess I will reiterate that this new House of the DRAGONS falls short of expectations as a stand alone story with poor casting in Matt Smith and unnecessary violence just for the sake of violence really disappointed."
"After all kinds of PR I dared to start on 'House of the dragon'. Except for the princess, none of the players have a real character. At least not a character we haven't seen 1000 times before. The Hollywood stories are allergic to anything unusual because it could deter the mob and therefore income, and that seems to be the case with ""House of the dragon"" as well. In GOT you could identify yourself with bad guys and feel sympathy for them, but in House of the Dragons everything is safely one-dimensional again. What is striking is that the series has also suddenly 'woken up' with enough dark actors (very discriminatory for people from Asian countries). Because this hip new form of apartheid seems ineradicable, I kept watching the series. Obviously, it's another plot-driven feast for screenwriters who know all about storytelling, but nothing about what really drives people. The princess was really the only character that motivated me to keep following the series. When I started to fell in love with her, the entire cast was replaced?!! WTF!! Really?? I don't feel taken seriously at all (exactly the opposite of GOT) and I immediately dropped out. Go Dragon house yourself! What are they thinking? Too many top chefs for a cake that everyone should like and therefore no longer tastes like anything."
"Trash show of the year.House of the dragon was so overwhelmingly BORING, they should never bring back another episode just cut your losses and run and never come back. There was hardly ever any action, just a bunch of talking where I could barely understand what they were saying.Please bring back Game of Thrones, that's where the real action is!!!!I didn't like any of the plots of the story, didn't like the king's wife, she was too young when they got married, so that was like statutory rape, even though I know that was their culture back in those days-- to marry young, and marry one of your family members which I think is disgusting."
"This is just another great example of how GOT was ruined. This is such a departure from realism just to attempt to extend the woke mentality of today, that it's just unbelievable. Allowing the fate of thousands, if not millions, to rely on a teenager to determine who would be ""best suited"" for themselves is just preposterous. If every teen who was infatuated with a boy was allowed to make decisions based on their teenage experience, then the world would be a much worse place. This is politics are the highest level, think if nations made major political decisions based on the whim of teenagers, how different the world would be. Totally unbelievable."
"The directors, writers, and producers should be ashamed of the disgusting world they imagined. It is a revolting celebration of grotesque brutality and evil. There is no redeeming quality or goal other than promote the darkest elements of humanity. I can't Imagine the sick minds that created such a horrific darkness. If you like unchecked violence with no goal other than suffering and bloodshed or death, then this is the show for you. Matt Smith is a terrible actor but seems appropriate in this nightmarish dystopian world. His own brooding seems more in line with his personality rather than any acting accomplishment."
"This is nothing like GoT nor does it have the storytelling of a great series. This is one story about the House and that's about it. There are no interesting characters and you honestly don't care about anyone in the story. In GoT you had Tyrian, Sam, Jon, Jamie, Hodor...etc. None of that here. The characters are bad, the acting is mediocre, the visuals are low-budget, and the story is boring.There are some that like this but I think it's more than hopium or delusion that this will return to GoT like storytelling and it just won't. Please don't waste your time on this disappointing show. It's all hype!"
"I like Paddy Considine, but this series is not for him; Milly Alcock and Matt Smith seemed too uptight. Maybe I was expecting same level as GOT, or maybe HBO is just milking it... I'll keep seeing it though; hopes it gets better."
"Stop leading your viewers on to offer them nothing!1) Building tension to disappoint...and over again. Roller coaster of absolutely nothing. Guess you only care about creating hype and not the viewers experience.2) The older actresses of Rhenyra and Alicent are absolutely nothing like their younger counterparts... but Ser Christon got to stay? Drunk casting director or just crushing on Fabien Frankel?3) How many traumatic birthing scenes does a season need in relation to absolutely zero battles... not very realistic for a Tale of Ice and Fire. Feet and birthing fetishes? Sure I'm not the only one to find this weird afHope season 2 is better but probably won't be watching considering we have to wait 1,5 years and didn't get any action in the first season. Not much to look forward to."
"House of the Dragon is nothing than a decent show, but is hampered by an inherent inability to mirror the power of the original, and also by a crucial gamble that severely limits one's ability to be reimmersed in the Westeros universe.This Targaryens-and-dragons-based series will trace the rise of House Targaryen from Aegon's Conquest through to the civil war known as The Dance of Dragons. This series is based on George R. R. Martin's Fire & Blood, a novel that exists in a finished form and covers all of the above material. Game of Thrones, one season covers one book. But that's not possible with Fire & Blood. There are too many kings, too many battles, and too many events in both the early going and in the later parts. Far more likely is that the show is planning to do a multi-season run, with each of these sections taking up at least one season, if not more. Most likely, the first seasons will cram all of the Aegon's Conquest battles in a rush to end with the forging of the Iron Throne. But the series would be better off splitting that war over two seasons (there's just so much history to cover) and end the first with the Burning of Harrenhal, instead.Either way, combat is coming."
"I wanted to write something about the show but i dont feel like wasting more time on it. Simply i dont care for any of the caracters. They are all horible people, simply said. I'll probably still watch the season 2 like i did with the last two episodes of first - snoozing on the couch after work. Oh my God, how i loved the Game Of Thrones. But what could we expect? D&D could not finish that right.. Im sorry for some spelling mistakes, its not my native language and I dont care that much to visit Google Translate for this. Again, this could be suficient for some average, generic, time-passing show, not for a prequel of Game of Thrones.."
"Actors are disaster... Daemon with two arrows inside body running full speed for Crab King ðŸ¤¦... from episode one to last, passed 20+ years, but je looks same? Does any movie or Tv show can pass today without colored People?! You ruined good story! I expected much more fights, more action, Here is only scenes how to cheat each other in fight for throne. This is fairy talle, not realizam, so put less politics and dirty games. Give to us more funny scenes, nature. It is Always fight between good and evil. Who is positive in this show? We Always Want to be on weaker side, for positive guys. Big dissapoint to me."
"Honestly it is one of the most ridiculous spin-offs I have seen and it baffles me that people thought it was overall a good idea.The saddest part is that it had great potencial if it at least had kept the essence of the original. The first 2 episodes were actually quite promising, but the show went downhill fast from the third episode on.Nevermind jumping years without any context or purpose, the poor choice of actors, the fact that some characters clearly aged beyond the passing of years and others remained exactly the same, the weak plot with barely any climaxes... The greatest downfall of this show is the lack of character development.GOT's was successful mostly because all characters evoked an emotion or another. You felt connected and interested in their arc in the story, you understood what motivated their choices. Well, unfortunately we don't find the same here. There is not a single character that makes you feel anything because you simply don't get to know them very way.Overall, it's a a boring soap opera with a couple dragons, some uninteresting family dynamics, and mostly mediocre acting."
"One would think the show runners learned something from GOT season 8. And so they did, hot dragon lady sells so why not duplicate it?Welcome to hot dragon lady v.2.1. Who are the other people in this story you ask? They are weak and ignorant, they aren't even worth a red wedding. All you want is hot dragon lady v 2.Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice. Eh the point being if you got hot blonds content don't matter.The only other highlight is Mat Smith from Dr Who. Or as you kids know him from the ""Morbid time"" meme. He plays as the most unsympathetic character you could ever imagen. After watching the first episode I just wanted everyone to die. But sadly they don't."
"Very nice series, very well made, awsome shooting and beautiful scenes.I do have a concern, because after 3 episodes, 90% of material is based on marriage issues (the king and his daughter), it became like watching a drama series.First 3 episodes lack politics, treason, deceit, magic, and definitely lack a lot of fighting (except the last 5 min in episode 3).Furthermore, GOT was about 7 kingdoms, the night's watch and many families/ stories at the same time. I am afraid HOTD might fall in the pit of dullness soon because so far the main events are nothing but 1 family drama over who is going to marry who and who will be the heir.Compared to GOT, I would give HOTD a 6, but given that it just started it deserves a 7 top so far."
"I was really hoping for more of the strange and unusual characters GOT had, maybe the Ice Spiders, maybe the origin stories of the Whitewalkers and Night King, more creepiness and monsters, but what we got was a boring prequel to GOT, minus the cleverness and unique story. I was so underwhelmed after the last episode of season one that I got the book and then couldn't believe how freaking borrrrring it was. I swear half the book was just a neverending litany of lords and offspring. Snorefest. And aside from a few mentions of Daemon's concubine being a witch, there didn't seem to be any other interesting characters- just a long war and tons of different families. I don't understand why they would opt to put this out instead of the pilot they spent some $30 million on which DID have origin stories of the Whitewalkers et al. Someone in the line of making the decisions on which offshoot to produce is waaaay out of touch."
"Every episode. I keep waiting for the classic turn of events that I had grown to love watching GoT and keep coming back for more. I've held out as long as I can, but I can't take it anymore. Maybe it's just the time period of the Targarians, but every episode I'm just brought down even more. This last episode was the straw that broke the camels back. I thought, yes, clean house but all you get is a discerning look and then nothing. I just want to see some blood, violence and some characters we've grown to love die a quick and unexpected death. HoT just seems like a cash grab using the foundation of a beloved series that ruined itself with quick and bad writing. Too much drama and not enough essence of a world built by its predecessor. Needless to say, I am let down."
"...They should have chosen more beautiful actors, something someone to make us stick to that show. Even the night king was cuter than that Targaryen Brother and the girl is a bit bland !! Jaime, Sansa, even the Glegane brothers, were cute guys, for example, or the others in got.The plot is a bit slow but got was also in the begining. Sex scenes could be done differently they are too much with no reason.I think the show has potential. As others say, the scenes are a bit dark, but the production can correct that easily. Costumes are nice the dragons rock and the castle scenes are ok.We will see.."
"Not quite sure what I was expecting. I have watched to the four episodes available. I'm not sure ""why""? I think I watch just hoping each week this Series gets better? So far it hasn't!So far to me it has been just a ""very mediocre drama"". A ""boring slow moving"" Story. With ""not even one"" appealing character in it so far. The acting over all is poor. With absolutely no character depth at all.Hard to watch most of the time even on the best of big screen TV's. The Scenes are dark. With the Interior Scenes very, very dark. And yes, hard to see even if you try to adjust or turn off your lighting.And as far as action Scenes. Well. The Action Scenes so far have been ""preposterously"" unbelievable! Yes, ridiculous for one side to have Dragons. And still have long Wars. Believe me, you have to watch the episode to see my meaning. So far the Dragons are just another after thought in the Series.The Jousting Scene could have been something special maybe, yet was just an after thought to a ""gruesome"" child birth.I guess my rating of just ""1"" Star comes from the fact. ""I just don't like the story"" so far. In spite of all the money Amazon spent on this production. Unless this thing takes a turn and gets much better. So far for me. It's a ""big miss'!"
"Where GOT finished on a rushed anticlimax, HOTD has continued in the same downward spiral .There are no complex characters, no humour, no interwoven plot lines ,no sense of an end game, none of elements that made GOT such a compelling are present in HOTD.Matt Smith really tries to impose himself as the bad guy and stands out in every scene he's in, Paddy Consedine is also excellent, Rhys Ifans isn't given nearly enough screen timeThe females characters in GOT were strong & multi layered , but here they are bereft of any real substance, and that's no fault of the actress's, it's just poor writing.Overall it is basically an extremely expensive ,badly lit soap opera.I wanted to love it ,but I just can't I'm afraid.GOT was steeped in legends and the prequel really should of explored where those legends came from, the white walkers,the wall, the tree with the face,where did the dragons come from and was there really magic in those days.That would of been an outstanding series.Oh well."
"The best way to view this series without getting too disappointed is to lower one's expectations and keep in mind that it's not Game of Thrones so it's just not to the same standard. I stopped watching several times because I was a bit bored and came back to it, which would never happen with GOT. It started off well but, it felt rushed, there wasn't sufficient world building. Like i wanted to see all the kingdoms at that time, more context would have been great. Kept wondering what was going on in Winterfell.....Where it all fell apart was the time jump and some of the stories just didnt make sense. I wish they didn't change Milly Alcock (young Rhaenyra) with the older actress and just aged her with make up. She was a far better actress to me and the change felt abrupt esp when there was no change with other characters. Then it didnt make sense to me that she had children who were obviously not her husbands when Daemons kids were clearly biracial or black, i mean they made such a big deal out of it and i just wondered, like what a hill to die on, they could have found another sperm donor to get white haired kids, like why was this so hard to solve, even gay husband doesnt mean he's sterile. If the writers just wanted drama, I don't see why they couldn't just find another storyline, the kids thing was not sellable at all. That said, Matt Smith ( Daemon) carried the show, he was by far the most fascinating character for me. I wish the story was centred on Daemon and Rhaenyra ( Milly Alcock not Emma D'Arcy) instead Daemon was made passive and Rhaenyra powerless until the very end. It was just annoying, I wanted to see their sordid steamy love story. The show was just not memorable."
"Sorry, so much expectations and the set and the production is really good, the Dragons, costumes, a lot more. Following, competing with ""Game of Thrones"" is a hard, maybe impossible mission. But, changing main character, kids fighting as a main event (""I want an eye""), killing the Beauties, too much geriatrics (""The long and winding road"", who wants to see it ?) and delivery room, black chracters with silver hair, cool. Sure, we need blood and brutality (smash the head with the sword, let the crabs eat them up, let them burn). Sorry once more, IÂ´m not hot to wait for the second season. Disappointed."
"House of the dragon was so overwhelmingly BORING, they should never bring back another episode just cut your losses and run and never come back. There was hardly ever any action, just a bunch of talking where I could barely understand what they were saying.Please bring back Game of Thrones, that's where the real action is!!!!I didn't like any of the plots of the story, didn't like the king's wife, she was too young when they got married, so that was like statutory rape, even though I know that was their culture back in those days-- to marry young, and marry one of your family members which I think is disgusting."
"Dramatic ""jump"" from 2nd to 3rd episode (several years?!), buffet table style for the King and his personnel (!?) 170 years before the time of Game of Thrones?!First two episodes are extremely slow. Communication between actors always very official, totally different style comparing to GoT.Very predictable plot. No adrenaline.I am watching this extension, only because I previously watched Game of Thrones. Otherwise, I would give up this series after the first or second episode. It reminds more on ""Bridgerton"".If you want to live on the GoT's fame - you will not be able to do it forever."
As a Big fan of GOT I was really sad when it ended it had such a Fantastic Cast that you grew to both love and understand each character. I was thrilled when I learnt of this Prequel and I can say frankly after watching the first episode that it has great promise! As with GOT the cinematography is superb and equally as good as GOT . Time will tell how good the cast is and wether we grow to love them the same. It will always be hard in the beginning as all the characters are fresh and new but am looking forward to finding out! Have to say Matt Smith still looks like Dr Who at the moment in my eyes hopefully that will change as he develops into his character. However for a first episode it kept me entertained and that's good.
"Just like Game Of Thrones, I only made it until the first beheading. Why do people want to see this sh-t? The same reason they want to see car accidents? I did like the smelly dragon, though."
"Taking snapshots of what was and attempting to build anticipation of what will.GoT did this extremely well with uniqueness.The inception of the story line shows lines of similar nature, but without the gore and blurred lines of what is MA, content is nothing.Prediciting, no engaging plot will exist until season 2.Why? Again."
"Don't expect Game of Thrones. If GOT were a Lexus, this is a Camry. It's essentially medieval Succession with the ugliest cast ever assembled. Seriously, the Targaryen are portrayed as a beautiful race. Paddy Considine looks like a Homer Simpson version of King Viserys. Matt Smith? Come on, I don't even need to say anything about Matt Smith. The faces on these guys are downright distracting. And just wait until you get to Ewan Mitchell as Prince Aemond. CGI could not make these characters more unappealing. And I haven't even mentioned Milly Alcock or Emma D'Arcy, both of whom are solid 4's out of 10.Beyond the distracting homeliness factor, the show itself is a drag. Yeah we get it, everyone wants to claim the seat of power. A few side plots wold be helpful. Whenever the plot drags, they throw in a dragon scene. Wow, how innovative. Most people are mindless dopes and will watch and like the show regardless I assume."
"First episode was ok. I'm not going to say it was bad, but at the end I was left feeling nothing.Tbh GOT did us so dirty at the end that I was extremely cynical going in. But my wife convinced me this show was worth a try.The visuals are good. The acting is good. The writing is kind of stupid tho. But the over arching story is seems solid so that could have just been a single episode."
"I haven't been so bored of a movie/series so much in ages. It is literally boring, bad acting, bad directing. Nothing is happening, it is slow paced and there is no real action. People have nostalgia but you cannot replace a diamong with glass. House of the Dragon was made purely for profit. There is really really nothing going on there. Watching 60+ minutes each episode - I'm sure you cannot resume what happened withing each episode because nothing really happens there. King got a son, they fought a bit, the end.I'm waiting for the next production. I gave this one a try. The review is too short. The review is basically too short. The review is not long enough."
"So the first three episodes... not bad. Then we run into superhero Daemon. Downhill from there. Constant introductions of characters who know things they could not possibly know or deducing things based off of absolutely nothing other than supposition. People show up in places they couldn't or shouldn't be. They might as well name these people Ser/Lady Plot Device because it seems as if the writers didn't know how to fill in plot holes so we just introduce a character to advance the story because, well, writing is hard.They didn't know how to write characters so they are parallels to all those in GoT (seriously, there's a poor man's littlefinger, Sansa, Joffrey, Varys, Jorah, etc....) Just without any of the actual development. I know GRRM isn't consulting (so he can focus on not writing the books), but it's lazy, awful, horrific writing.The bar set by Benioff and Weiss was low and yet somehow we have found two writers who match their lack of comprehension of GRRMs world. The only redeemable quality is the actors are amazing. What a shame that their talents are wasted acting out a script that might as well be written in crayon."
"(Groan!) Here we go...another attempt to make the world's greatest ""Old England Meets Gladiator"" series!! I get the feeling they did this series only because they could. And, there it lays, in the cold, dank, bloody English dirt! Moving on.....let's get some real entertainment. Let's see what's on The Weather Channel!"
"Went in with no expectations. I have a clear understanding that there are certain shows that need the entire first episode as an introduction. Episode 2 felt the same but gave it another chance with Episode 3. By now, as a viewer, I should be entertained and counting down the days to Episode 4, but it's not happening for me. I can no longer waste my time on drivel. There are way too many one dimensional wooden characters and the storyline is meaningless. I watched 3 episodes and I feel nothing. I did not go in and compare this to GOT. There has been numerous series that capture your attention within the first 15 minutes. I have put in close to 3 hours - a painful, disappointment. I'd be more entertained watching a family of turtles race around Daytona."
"I wanted to like this show. Ever since it was announced by HBO in 2019 I've been waiting for the vacuum left by GoT to be filled once more with its much-hyped successor, House of the dragon.Alas, my expectations were not met. The first episode, I'll admit, wasn't so bad. I was expecting it to be slow-going in order to establish the scene and characters. However, by episode 3, I grew weary. My main issue with HoTD is the excessive dialogue, simple, hackneyed plot, the inconsistent pacing and casting, as well as the characterisations. I did not find myself connecting with any of the characters - most are shallow and uninteresting (or killed off before we get to know them), and this was seriously exacerbated by the change of actors.Also, I understand that GoT is guilty of this, but I have to say the amount of gratuitous scenes in this show is astounding. I mean, did we seriously just watch a teenage boy masturbating off a window?!! Who came up with that??I don't know if its just me, but the VFX seems a little off as well. The dragons look more spindly and awkward and overall just don't look as impressive or awe-inspiring."
"If you think this is good your doing the first a misjustice. This one is slow quite frankly kind of boring and trying to think dragons themselves are the only reason people watch this your wrong. Predictable plot, terrible casting, and so slow moves like molasses. None of the characters are truly likeable. Kind of hoping most of the people die, just watching gory deaths does not make a great show. Both sides have dragon so maybe there will be an epic dragon fight, but the intelligence of the first one is severly lacking in this prequel. Prequels rarely live up to the originals and this one is no different. Trying to hint that the king is going through gray scale might be the most interesting of this. Maybe when they show us the other regions we will meet some interesting character who have more depth than a puddle, but here is to hoping. The character we care about looks 12 not 15 and they are trying to clone what danearys was.Hbo last gas before it moves over to discovery falls flat and i wait the next season of sucession to actually watch something good."
"House of the Dragon disappointed me. It reminded me very much of The Witcher, in that I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but the majority of the story consisted of conversations about politics. When a few action scenes came up, I got excited and thought maybe it was finally going to pick up, but even these were uninteresting. I think the biggest problem is that the characters, or maybe it was the actors playing them, are all so smiley about everything. There appears to be some real intrigue and back-stabbing brewing, but the characters all respond to everything, even serious matters, with a smarmy grin and a gentle chuckle, as if they were talk show hosts responding to a low billed guest. It made everything seem so phony and unimportant. Game of Thrones was definitely soap-opera-ish on many levels, but the actors showed range, and the story had layers. These actors seem to be in the same emotional state almost indefinitely, and the story consists of one very thin layer."
"I'm looking forward to ""J. R."" involves in dragon egg business with Targaryen Inc. While Princess becomes a multi millionaire but in danger to lost everything because she is in love with a peasant.Hopefully, her uncle is a crab hunter in the north of Valyria... He became only protector of her niece but... I think that is enough about the script of House of Dragon soap opera. I don't want to spoil your pain while watching the show by remembering the strong plot of Game of Thrones.PS: I don't remember who wrote the article ""Season 8 of Game of Thrones was the worst of all time in fantasy tv series""... Nope... Watch this brother, you will find out another pain in your chest!"
"I managed to hold out only about 20 minutes watching the first episode. The confusing lack of good story telling combined with quite dark photography convinced me quickly that I was wasting my time. This fantasy was reputed to be HBO's answer to the Netflix Lord of the Rings offering. There is no comparison, as Dragon fails miserably to even stand on its own. I think it attempted to be of the same genre as the acclaimed Game of Thrones, also highly overrated.Compare this with 2010's 'Pillars of the Earth' and 'The Work of Angels' to see how a mediaeval period films should look and satisfy the viewer."
"... turned into a contrivance. The beginning was great but morphed into the ridiculous. There really did seem to be a story of depth at the start. Great characters, storytelling, actors and drama, but the writers clearly ran out of ideas and had no ultimate vision. I rapidly lost interest after the first half of the season but continued to watch hoping for some memorable twist in the narrative. Sadly it became more disappointing. The script just seemed forced and rushed in the end to simply complete what had been started. It, as always, these days becomes about ""the message"". It's all about strong women, and weak men or some other political point to be made. Yawn! I want entertainment, not political messages rammed down my throat, however subtle the writers think they are being. A missed opportunity for something memorable."
"Woke Hollywood is failing. They need to stop forcing. They need to give up rewriting history even in fictional accounts. It's not helping anything, but losing an audience. Please give up being woke. It's all just falling apart. I mean ""let's rewrite Vikings with an all black cast."" That's the impression being given. Even a black person has a hard time watching such obvious fiction. What are we trying to prove. This is supposed to be a time window not such a complete farce that it has no level of believability, whatsoever. I don't expect to be a main character on the show, ""Empire."" Leave believability in your casting. Thank you."
"The acting was good. The plot was good. However like many other shows, many scenes or almost entire episodes were shot in such darkness we couldn't see anything and had to skip over. I get that some scenes require darkness, but so dark that you lose the plot is silly. We could hear a dragon grumbling in one long dark scene, people huffing and puffing, yet we had absolutely no idea what was happening. If this continues, we will need to abandon, after all....what's the point in sitting staring at a dark screen with yelling and grumbling? Why do directors do this so often? We've missed many a movie that was shot too darkly. I guess the darkness in some movies is supposed to provide drama, but there's NO drama if you haven't got a clue what's happening."
"I got bored very quickly and stopped after 10 or 15 minutes. Then I read the reviews. Plan on giving it another shot, but giving my initial feelings. Still hoping to get into this even half as much as Game of Thrones."
"Incoherence, inconsistency with a character, same thing that happened with Daenarys. The inconsistency this time is that, with no doubt at all, no discussion should be had that Rhaenys should have burned the Queen and princes, together with the new appointed king Aegon. Such obvious choice.And the end of the Season, I believe it's of bad taste. That shouldn't have happened, mainly for the so said inconsistency. One bad taste event, made possible by a choice inconsistent with Rhaenys.Now I decided, with no doubt, I won't watch not 1 more episode. I'm sure the show's score on each episode will start to drop. Anyway, this is annoying me, I wanted to be entertained."
"I think the video editors were most likely drunk when doing their job.More than half of the series, you cannot see anything. It's either in the night, or inside the castles. Damn, where are the lights, I wonder. In the beginning, I thought there was some brightness issue on the screen, but everything was fine as it should be.How can you rate it when you cannot see anything? I would gladly rate this zero (if there was an option). The only reason for rating it 3 is due to the storyline.Perhaps it would be better to listen to an audio book instead, lol. ðŸ˜œ"
I do not understand why people have rated it so high?Did y'all manage to see?
Has no interesting characters. Drags on with no action. Filming was so dark sometimes that you couldn't even see anything. I turned the brightness and contrast to max on my tv and still couldn't see. I don't understand what people are liking on this series. Daemon Targaryen Is the only interesting character and even some of the scenes with him are ridiculously funny that he is not killed or that he can get away with whatever he is doing. This series has obviously lacked any real substance since it's not based on any real writing just like the finale of Game of Thrones lacked any substance. It was all contrived to make money off the real writing that was done well.
"The first Rhaenra was the only reason to watch. She's gone and the show sux. Storyline, cast, no action... everything i try to watch I fall asleep.I bet George R. R Martin is disgusted by it.Your expectations will be shattered if your hoping for ANYTHING that even resembles Game of thrones. The only way the show could be redeemed at this point is to do another stupid time jump and replace all the characters with one's with such beauty and charisma as the original cast. I guess they are dragging the storyline out so they can make as many episodes as possible but it will only backfire. And for God sakes kill that ugly Daemon character. Don't you get it he is costing you viewers."
"It started out as great, but then the writers got confused.House of the Dragon is an adaption for George R. R. Martin's fake history book ""Fire & Blood"". I think they were unsure what to believe in the book and tried to mix what their imagination wanted and the book's events... but ended up making a mess.Episode 4 is where I started getting confused with where they wanted to take the story to, and from there it just got worse. I kept coming back for the performances brought on by Olivia Cooke, Emma D'Arcy, Matt Smith, Paddy Considine, etc. The last two episode were the biggest let downs, personally, and I fear the actors' greatness won't be enough to bring me back for a second season."
"GoT was in the right place at the right time. Not really excelling at anything.I found it impossible (i do not use that term lightly) to not look for other activities to do while letting HoD play. A slog from start to finish.Also the CG made me audibly laugh, it looks like a certain dragon game I enjoyed on the Playstation 2, but has no place in an HBO series.The CG wasn't even the worst part, the writing was so incredibly dull and predictable. Sorry Doctor Who, you got stuck with another dud (I'm looking at you Morbius)The only good to come from it was the bets we place on over/under of nudity in the episodes."
"There's a $15 million budget for each episode, what's up with the characters hair, looks fake! Also CGI in the crowd at the jousting tournament, castles in the background and the jumpy dragons?! Give your loyal audience a little more credit! You've got 9 more episodes, so hopefully someone is editing the CGI-FX for episodes 2 thru 9."
"First off, there are ZERO protagonists in this show, everyone is a villain. That coupled with each episode time-jumping 5-10 years giving the viewer no chance to even get to know the complexities of these horrible characters, horrible as in they are all bad guys. I don't care at all about anyone, those that start off as a maybe turn out just like every one else. I get that some stories can have all antagonists and we're left to either root for the lesser of evils or just to observe in that state of dislike. For these reasons, i don't care about the show, i couldn't be less interested in a follow up season, maybe i'll watch it when it ends, maybe i'll forget it exists. I'm guessing Martin gave HBO a rough outline, basically character sheets and let them loose on the script. It reeks of poor structure, and those very basic of character mistakes i described above. What a waste of a great IP."
"While the story is ok, something went terribly wrong with the cinematography. The color palette is orange and blue. Subtracting from this is the backgrounds, even indoors, are greyed out by fog. The contrast is poor throughout.I tried adjusting the color on my TV, to no avail. There was no fixing it. I thought there was something wrong with the TV, but other shows look fine.In short, the show is difficult to see. Eye candy it ain't. They clearly spent a lot of time on the art, costumes, sets, and cgi, but it's mostly for naught because the cinematographer made sure you can hardly see much of it.How can one make a zillion dollar show, and nobody involved has the guts to say ""blue and orange sucks. Where's the red and green?"" It's as ugly as the long-forgotten 2 strip technicolor from the early 1930s. It's long-forgotten for a reason."
The premise is uninteresting as it is because it does not have any mystery to it as it was with Game of Thrones where we from the very start always wondered who would sit on the Iron Throne.The show however is all about the struggle to keep the Iron Throne.My prediction for this series is more of family drama with some blood and sex thrown in and also the same hook of a dreadful Winter which we all know now was just hype.
"What a disappointment.After all the hype a very bad screenplay ( who wrote this?) surely not from the pen of George R R Martin although at the end of the original GOT everyone I think was disillusioned.The pondering storyline is so so boring and little or no action going on where in the original there was always some underlying betrayal from the other distant houses. This is taking too long to grab anyones interest and is totally confusing at times with the sudden leap in years with not even a mention on screen of how many have past? This might have helped.It seems that having G R R as a consultant on this show has not given any input as far as I am concerned as it is no comparison to the original first 7 series of GOT at least, the latter being guessed?The older princess suddenly had princes, not from Ser Criston Cole but from another unknown character suddenly thrust upon the audience and then quickly dispatched to far off lands to save her embarrassment. Then it's back to the uncle ( after the dispatching of her gay husband) where did it go wrong with Criston?The writing of this boring plodding narrative needs a mighty shake up!More information please of what year we are in if only a date on screen might help a totally confused audience."
"There are many that enjoy this. I am not one of them. I found only one of the cast members that interested me, that is the Knight Sir Criston Cole, as he was the only one that demonstrated any character, flawed as he is (like us all). So before you launch a spear at me, this really is my kind of show. I've always enjoyed the tales of medieval times.Firstly with a few exceptions, I find the clast unattractive. There's few characters who's story I find compelling. For a show called ""House of Dragons,"" there's precious few shots of dragons. The costumes and scenes are incredible, however it all just seems too dark. With all the grand costumes it all seems washed out."
"It is enough to look closely at the scene of tournament fights, and it will be clear that the screenwriters do not understand what they took to film. Beautiful - no argument, but nonsense. Tournaments are not a place where everyone gathered to kill each other, a tournament is a natural festival, along with which there are knights' battles. Fights, mind you, not fights to the death. The protagonist living at court doesn't know how to thank a lord, what are you talking about? It's been taught there since she was two years old. The plot itself is boring, the plot is not interesting, all their squabbles and quarrels are just not interesting to follow. Do not watch it under any circumstances."
"I could barely make it through the first episode with the creepy hints of pedophilia and incest, the unnecessary use of porn and orgies, and the excessive use of gore.The production quality was poor. The CGI dragon at the end looked like it was from a 90s video game. The casting was pretty bad. The main villain (I don't even care what his name was) looked like an elf from LOTR. The Dany double lacked any charisma. The dialogue was difficult to understand because of the strong accents and booming sound effects. The story was completely predictable and boring. The producers didn't even come up with a new theme song. The song was part of using the Nostalgia card heavily throughout the episode to get viewers to forget they were watching a heap of dung.By the end of the episode I hated HBO and David & David even more for what they did to Dany and GOT. I wish HBO had remade season 8 of GOT instead of putting out this garbage.Glad I didn't have to waste money on an HBO subscription and got the episode during a free trial week."
"First Princess kept me interested until episode 5. Then came the 6th episode and only GOT knows how and why we jumped in time! Some characters are completely changed to show their age/maturity, some have make ups to show their age and some stayed as young as ever! What a dilemma to the viewers!Episode 6 really was disappointing with almost no connection to the episode 5, boring and confusing casting, and without any ingredients to keep me interested! Half way through,I ended up checking sports news updates!This series is missing any wise characters like we had in GOT. We miss those punch dialogues which were smart and timely! This series is so clearly missing a TYRION LANNISTER & LORD VARYS!"
"From the disabled foot fetish, to the first 30 minutes randomly/pointlessly trying to find Aegon, to the last garbage scene where the 'queen who could have been' decides to kill tons of innocent people and then just leaves the guilty. Literally just turns around and leaves. Oh my god was that awful. Episodes 7 and 8 were a huge improvement from what seemed like was going to be a completely one dimensional show based off of nostalgia from the first few seasons of GOT, which made it seem as though we were headed for a great finale, but episode 9 could not have disappointed more. Given the size of the production value, it is astounding how these show-runners are unable to write a decent story line without George's detailed novels to work off of. It is equally astounding that there isn't a single person in the room able to speak up and say how objectively bad it would be to have a story play out like this. It is hard to imagine how episode 9 could have been worse."
Seems like this was a total money grab. Didnt have enough time to tell the story correctly with details the just hella fast-forward it the girl was 14 then 18 in one ep to the next. So many questions unanswered so not GOT they just kept the song and look. Was expecting more like session 1 for session 1 but they kept the same vibe from session 8 of GOT rushed.Seems like this was a total money grab.

"Soooo my first review, i'm a movie and series addict and GOT was brilliant and with reason the top serie ever made. With all the political intrigue we had also great action sequences and a great underlying threat , the undead.We followed a great number of characters, strange gods and cults.What do we have now ? Home and away or neighbours in a GOT setting, same talent actors, same great story writing and so much to look forward to :("
"so yes visually stunning but incredibly boring and dont think it will get any better , noooooo cause there is nothing going on ..."
"seriously i dont care who wins the fight for the throne, who cares."
This is beyond ludicrous. They started this with Game of Thrones and doubled down on ridiculously poorly lit scenes for this series. I'm giving it two stars because it's a decent show for the radio...perhaps that's the medium the directors would like to be working?Maybe the number of complaints about the lighting will finally get through and they will do a better job on future seasons. I kind of doubt that though as they seemingly ignored the complaints about the final season of Game of Thrones.I guess on the positive side they won't have to pay the actors much for future seasons as they could sub in new people and few would be able to notice a difference.This is a show I was looking forward to...
The worst tv show i ever seen. And its to boring to wtach alone and i hope if there any intrsting momnet in some place to watch and the chr is not deeb enoph to be a perfect as well we wnt so i hope that will be fixed in the s2 if they have inoph money.The worst tv show i ever seen.

"As someone enthralled by Game of Thrones I come to House of the Dragon full of anticipation, even salivation. So I suppose it's not surprising that so far I am slightly underwhelmed.The characters are well drawn but a little one-dimensional, certainly compared to the more nuanced and complex Lannister family for example. The plot is rather ponderous so far. Even the dragons are, well, a bit plastic looking by today's standards of CGI.And there's no humour to relieve the long, slow, plod. No Tyrion to amuse us with drunken tales and endless misdemeanours in the whore houses. Heck, none of the characters are even gauche enough to yell at us to fly through the moon door. What does Daemon Targareyn do when confronted by his niece on the rampart? Well I'll leave that unspoilt but it's hardly a Game of Thrones moment, is it?I'm sure it will pick up. It had better."
"This show lacks character development terribly. They seem to just rush to summery a story on TV but not trying to do anything else.I don't care if it's slow or fast, as long as they spend a lot more time creating depth in each character (including the children and each dragon), that would make much difference.You just don't care about any character or what happens to them, even if all dragons die, I wouldn't care, that's how bad it is. No character you really root for and no character you really hate, GOT did really well with that, dang even a wolf in GOT was more interesting than a dragon in HOD, even a servant was more interesting than these any important characters in HOD.They just spend time creating gruesome scenes to shock audiences but done in a bad taste.Please change TV writers and directors for upcoming seasons."
"A somewhat impressive start is muddled by lots of blurry and fuzzy shots of obvious CGI scenery that doesn't inspire the viewer much. Overall the first episode is good. However, I don't feel excited to watch more. Not nearly as excited as I was when I watched the first episode of Game of Thrones. My fear is it's too much of a melodrama even though a dragon is seen in the first five minutes of the opener. I had to wait approximately 10 seasons before I saw a dragon in the first GOT. I'll stick with it, but I'll also buy more coffee!"
"I didn't watch Game of Thrones the first two seasons because the ""dungeons & dragons"" genre just isn't my cup of tea. But when season 3 rolled around, my favorite actor, Ciaran Hinds, was due to be in it, so I put it on my list. Just before the start of that season, HBO showed reruns of the first two seasons, so I figured I'd watch a few to get an idea of what was going on, etc., They started with season, episode one, so I tuned in....and I was hooked! Mainly because they didn't play by the rules of successful TV...1. You don't hurt children...at the end of the first episode, Bran gets pushed out a 3rd floor window by Jaime, who's boinking his sister in the tower2. You don't hurt animals... The Mountain decapitates his horse because it caused him to lose the jousting tournament...3. You don't kill off main characters...two words..Red Wedding..two more words...Headless Ned ..and the most colorful cast I've ever seen. Hands down, favorite character, Tyrion Lannister!!! God bless Peter Dinklage!!! Characters you loved, you hated...if they didn't kill off Robert Baratheon, I was going to. I still think Cercei hired the boar to kill him. And I literally got up and danced when Joffery bit the dust. But they also had characters change and grow over the years...Jaime in season 1 was not the Jaime in season 8...No, I told you all that to tell you this...I always read the user reviews here to get an idea of whether I want to watch a series, movie, etc., but I didn't for House of the Dragon, because it's a prequel to GofT, right, so it has to be good, right?I've never been so bored in my life...another reviewer mentioned you just don't care about any of these people. There's no one you're rooting for or even care to. I'll watch it through to the end of this season, and I understand there'll be a season 2, but I won't bother with it.."
"I at first thought maybe I'm being unfair but I began rewatching GOT after watching the hotd finale and it's truly chalk and cheese.The story has too many holes and appears as though they are in a hurry to get somewhere ( unfortunately in almost every episode they go nowhere really fast).The acting is sub standard at best.Matt Smith and Emma D'arcey seem intent on trying to win the worst actor in the show award.I must admit I like the dragons, definitely the highlight of the show thus far.Ewan Mitchell and Olivia cooke deliver impressive enough performances but the rest of the caste is disappointing.Direction too seems to lack, well simply put direction.It's an effort that can be deemed average at best in terms of popular television but when compared to spectacle that was game of thrones it falls way short.The best scene was the final scene of season 1 (in my opinion the only scene worth watching).Disappointing to say the least."
This sucks big time compared to either 1 of the GOT. I don't think the directors had seen even 1 episode from GOT and this whole season will fit within 2 or 3 episodes. Too many unnecessary long shots like an Oscar planned Drama movie like showing King's sickness and moaning for a long time and giving birth sequences which doesn't fit the story or screenplay. There is no real story shown and there is not even a single action sequence which is worth watching. This is so boring and especially the last episode have no real strong ending. As per other's feedback I do see that all the episodes are taken with poor lighting or background like a cheap 3rd grade movie.
Whats ur idea and/or feel for this role? I will say openly:
"Who is Emma D'arcy? Little bit time before she comeback to castle with dragon and speaking with her pregnant mom. Face,gestures,height and hip.....!!!Production companies.... They chose the wrong artistI can't see those stubborn eyes. I can't feel the serious face coming out of the fire. Remember !"
"I pulled HoD up last night and made it about 6 mins before I noped out. It's definitely ESG caliber writing, acting and CGI. Gonna be 2 thumbs down from me."
"I've downgraded my rating and changed my review because it was written prior to the fast forward slash jump-in-time disaster. I've also just read that this series isn't on the docket for 2023 either. That's good, it should give some time to reflect on this season's missteps and perhaps come back with a better product for 2024.The season overall was too much too fast. Or crammed, if you will. I know this was all planned out, but that doesn't stop it from being pure suckage. No matter the source material, pacing is everything, something that the series' powers that be failed to grasp. It's painfully obvious that there was little to no anticipation as to how the story would unfold through the eyes of the viewer, and it's hard to believe that anyone had a reasonable road map for season one.I now understand why people complained across social media platforms about the role replacements. Emily Carey and Milly Alcock could have easily continued in their roles with only a tiny bit of aging makeup. It wasn't necessary at all to switch them out since it's only 10 years. At their real life ages they could have easily pulled it off convincingly and seamlessly. This was a horrible decision.Emma D'Arcy brings absolutely nothing to the table as Rhaenyra other than reading lines out loud. Where Alcock's version of Rhaenyra was dynamic and energized, D'Arcy's version is monotone, monoface and downright tedious and the opposite of interesting. Nothing against D'Arcy personally, this was just a really bad casting decision and a hospital food level of bland interpretation of the role. Huge casting risk there, and it didn't pay off.Like it or not, the Game of Thrones books have incest situations in them. Like it or not, Daemon and Rhaenyra's union is crucial to the source material. There was tangible chemistry and passion between Alcock and Smith, whereas there is less than none between D'Arcy and Smith, despite the elaborate candlelit setting for their coupling 10 years later. Daemon is the only character of substance in the relationship.Viserys's death took way too much time. Watching it unfold was as long and agonizing as his illness. It's like a bad polar opposite to the time jump. First we get time jumped, then we go irrationally slow. Again, pacing is everything.In the season finale, Lucerys is killed by Vhagar. The writing for that was truly amateur since the writer(s) did nothing to hide what would happen. There was no worthy attempt at a GoT level of shock and awe that we're accustomed to. No stunning season finale was to be had here at all.A good comparison is this: HotD is a sub par spinoff to GoT just as Vikings: Vahalla is a sub par spinoff to Vikings. It's undeniable in both cases.At the time of this writing, I have no enthusiasm for the next season of HotD at all, unlike the level of anticipation I had for Game of Thrones. Since there's no more time jumps (according to Condal) are we really stuck with this Rhaenyra? If so, I'm out.Below is part of my original review. I had to delete some my (formerly) enthusiastic comments as they were written prior to the time jumping and recasting.-----------------------------------------------Episode 1 wasn't an edge-of-my-seat epic opener; however, it did set the tone of power struggles and conflict between some of the prominent power-hitting families in the original series. I look forward to seeing how this plays out in the past.My immediate distraction was the stark difference between GoT VFX and this series. Dragon riding is not exactly up to snuff in this first episode. With such an unimpeachable and impeccable precedent, this was a huge disappointment. Since Targaryens and dragons belong in the same breath, it would seem prudent that a greater effort would be put into attaining GoT level footage. In addition to the CGI there were a couple glaring green screen hiccups on the ground level as well.Is it me or did King's Landing have a somewhat different shoreline shape 172 years in the past? Maybe there will be a rational explanation for that later on. Time-in-reverse beach erosion? Dredging? A a sudden disaster, like a tsunami?There were plenty of Easter eggs. That was fun.I'm fine so far with the lore building. Westeros wasn't built in a day. I'm intrigued and excited for what is to come."
This is different from Game of thrones but still has its roots. I absolutely loved this episode it had given me everything I wanted. I am glad that they didn't tone this show down from Game of thrones. I am really excited to see the other kingdoms as well.My criticisms are that the introduction is not the map of westoros or the other place that they were at and that I expected there to be more Targaryens.I can't wait for the next episode!
"Spent a lot on bad CGI. I hope it improves. Seems like a money grab so far. Hope the acting gets better, falls flat. Characters appear to be building, but none that stand out. Not enough voices strong enough to carry it especially with how terrible Game of Thrones ended. Looks like more of the same weak plot. Again hope it gets better."
"Before David Benioff and D. B Weiss ruined Game of Thrones with season 6-7, it was the most compelling show on TV. This show is similar to the last couple seasons of GOT. There is lack of character development, incoherent story lines, everything is a mess. The only think it has going for it it's that it's connected to GOT. I believe if it had to stand on its own, it would have been cancelled by now. It is beautifully shot but that's where it ends. It's hard to get invested with the characters since they are all over place and they keep jumping a few years in between episodes. It's basically a TV version of GOT footnotes for dummies."
"With the tremendous cast of Game of Thrones , the phenomenal acting across the board episode after episode, there is no way to compare this to that. Somewhere, somehow they lost a key figure or figures involved in the making and production of G. O. T. Whoever the person or persons were that made nearly every actor/character and every plot and nearly ever scene so amazing either did not return or were not asked to return and it has made ALL the difference. Someone or ones were an artistic genius/s and they are not here anymore sadly. It is so/so and has a few moments here and there. Matt Smith, being the one that stands out above the rest and even Fabien F. Others are not given the best parts or expected to perform as all did in G. O. T., without Fabien and Matt I will feel very cheated entirely instead of mostly. Hopefully with the cast switch soon it will begin to gain 'something' , but clearly the behind the scenes wondermaker or makers are gone and I hope, since everyone holds on to wht legacy and longing G. O. T. Left us with comes back in someway even in part. PLEASE bring whoever it was Back to help if a season 2 even happens. G. O. T. Had the magic and genius the likes of which are rarely seen.. Who were those genius that didn't follow to this one??? Will you please stand up and come back? Find them! Pay them whatever you have to to make them come back... I'm not into all the nudity and such, however, in G. O. T. Almost everything made you feel some strong emotion or like being caught up in the world and characters to Love , hate and love again the best and worst. It was a rare and privileged world to have experienced and people are still chasing after it in HOTD, but it is not there but in remnants and rumors. The music still captivates and reminds us, but most of the performances and script do not bring us back.UPDATE (Boring Boring Boring and no real acting at all now, by Episode 8).Maybe.. Hopefully.. Please..? If the Hound were still around and saw this he would surely say what a bunch of f. C@#@@."
"Well it's the last episode before the season finale and I truly hoped that things would pick up, people would grow some hair on their ass and be true to Game of Thrones. This is not the case. They pussyfoot around and they play with storylineswhile picking and choosing stupid moments for ridiculous scenes. Storyline is weak the characters are extremely weak it's a huge disappointment I'll be shocked if it makes it to season two. They really need to ramp it up and get back to what Game of Thrones is really all about despite the fact that is set 300 years prior to Game of Thrones they need to get their acts together."
"They had so much they could play on with this series and it's honestly just so boring. Game of thrones had so much going on and it was just a genuinely great show with the exception of the last two seasons which were, well, not great. It feels like they brought that lazy writing back for The house of the dragon because your not really rooting for anyone in this show. It felt like the whole season just drug on. With glimpses of action here and there, then we're back to dragging the show on. It just not even close to what I was expecting. I thought with GRRM on board it was gonna being this amazing show and I'm hoping they get it together for season 2 because I hate to see such an amazing fantasy world to be butchered."
"Fist off, the timeline is constantly jumping around and they don't tell you when one of these time jumps happen either!Second, as soon as a plot starts to develop in one of these times a time jump happens. And that plot becomes useless garbageThird, there is no main villain. This is like watching a wall where every now and agian some paint chips off.Fourth, the characters are boring and are hard to even Get to know because as soon as you start to the timeline changes by 20 years I the future or something!Together this mess of a show combines into a massive burning trash pile that doesn't even make sense."
"Just like the new Lord of the Rings show, this is another attempt to take a show that was beloved by many and use it as a vehicle to to deliver a woke bomb to the masses.Just skip it. I'm amazed that anyone is even interested in the first place considering what they did to the original show.Whoever wrote this show clearly did absolutely no research in to the original works. They blatantly just changed a lot of GoT lore to fit a narrative that they want to push. No one wants that. So yawn-worthy. How someone gave this the green light is beyond me.This show is also terribly written and shot. The cinematography is terrible compared to the original show."
"I have tried two episodes and so far it has been filmed too dark which makes it difficult to even see facial expressions. I was just watching the scene with the king's daughter talking to the potential king's mother in law. The potential was facing the daylight and you still could not see her facial expressions. Then there is the pan up to Dragonstone before the egg discussion, way too dark.I think this could be an issue with actors that can't convey any content with their face or we are watching a very expensive audio book.Not really sure it's worth investing any more time with, will try one more episode."
"I'm struggling between 3 and 5 stars, I wasn't taken by the hype of GoT and didn't watch any of the episodes until the final series was announced.I binged.1-7 prior to season 8 and really enjoyed the full story.Unfortunately the I should have applied the same approach to HotD.HotD steps straight into the politics and intrigue of the Targaryen family, there's enough action to maintain interest.Whilst HotD is definitely not a 1/10 neither can it be rated 10/10 on the basis of two fairly slow episodes.Well timed or poorly timed to coincide with the new LOTR production but I'm finding the trend for franchised 'flogging to death' of prequels tedious.I feel that it hides an inability to.write (or adapt ) anything new."
"This is a B grade version of the original. Awful casting for the lead parts. Milly Alcock CAN NOT carry this role. Her and her odd mouth region bring down the grade of the whole show.And don't get me started on Matt Smith in platinum blonde. With a beard and long dark hair - sure. I haven't been so disappointed in a Dr Who since I saw Christopher Eccelston's pee pee in The Leftovers.It is fun to drink and watch though, just so you and your partner can make fun of how bad it is compared to the original.This is a B grade version of the original.

"That's really all I have to say. Except for we do learn a bit more about dragons and that's always a good thing! And the dragons in this series are magnificent!! (most of the time..)Matt Smith is about the only saving grace, not his character, but Matt Smith, the actor. And Eve Best. They carry the shows continuity along nicely.The king had a fairly consistent 5 o'clock shadow that made him look .... tired and seedy. But mostly seedy. He wasn't terribly good GoT genetic material. IMHO.I agree with a lot of the reviewers who say that none of the characters are worth our effort to care about them. It's hard when really, all we see them do is screw and fight - in all sorts of places. However!!! They are all beautifully costumed (if they aren't stark naked!). Even the art in the queen's rooms is erotic. Someone had a fun time in set decoration!!I am watching this for costumes only. I do a lot of fast forwarding.Would I watch it again? No. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't give it a go and see if it's for you. You might enjoy the costumes too!!"
"I just binged the first season of GoT again after finishing up the first season of HotD, and I'm tempted to say that they're incomparable, but of course, comparing the two is unavoidable.GoT season one is from 2011, over a decade old, and leaps and bounds better in every single way. It's astonishing, really. One would think that some experience had been drawn from GoT to make HotD even better, but it's an apparent regression in every area.GoT is captivating from the very first scene, even after having watched it more than half a dozen times, and from then on the immersion never skips a beat and is kept in place while the rich world with its deep lore and many plot lines keep unfolding. Every episode about an hour long go by so quickly because of being so entertaining.HotD on the other hand, a whole season has passed and nothing memorable has happened, and only in the last episode did it deliver a scene that was akin to anything as captivating or exciting as scenes delivered throughout every single episode of GoT. All of the episodes of HotD are worse in every way than every episode of GoT, even with season eight being so poorly received.HotD has episodes almost exclusively revolving around the same handful of family members, having the same dreary conversations over and over, seemingly only interrupted by yet another birthing scene. Yes, it's the story of that one house, but GoT was the story of the throne and we still had plenty of insight into the adventures of several other characters and the world in general.Somehow HotD managed to feel drawn out and rushed at the same time. What we got from the whole season could have been done in two episodes, but should have probably been two seasons with much more intricacies and a more flushed out world and differing perspectives of the house in question than what we got.Skipping 10 years in the middle of the season was a big mistake imo. Suddenly relations between characters are very different without any explanation or apparent reason, leaving much to be desired regarding character development. This was certainly not helped by changing out several of the actors, causing much confusion. Additionally, it's apparent that the four actresses playing the central roles of the queen and the princess interpret their characters differently from one another, further clouding the nature of the relationship between the two characters, which is especially unfortunate for the progression of the storyline. And the choice of changing the actresses seems so unnecessarily unfortunate, as well as additionally confusing, because of them being adults when other adult characters look like they haven't aged a day and yet others have been aged with makeup or CGI. It was really a disastrous decision that went a long way in sinking the whole season.Probably the most surprising thing about HotD so far though is that the CGI is so much worse. The development on that front has been astounding even since the last season of GoT, and then we get this from a top tier production which is based on dragons where CGI needs to be on point but instead looks like a season of Merlin (2008). Such a shame.I was considering binging the season of HotD since I'm not a fan of weekly episodes to get a more continuous storytelling experience, but it's just not entertaining enough to binge, not captivating, not exciting. Just the same darkly lit backdrop with the same unexpressive faces having unsurprising conversations.Nobody gets along, so there's plenty of tedious drama, but there's no real intrigue or clever deception. Never did I think ""Oh, I didn't see that coming"", which is so characteristic of GoT, but rather sighs of fatigue due to having to sit through the dumbed down dialogues of uninteresting characters that are either killed off before we're invested in them or obviously protected by plot armour and quarrel like seniles at an elderly home. Watching my nieces of 5 and 2 arguing over who has the right to play with that one doll is more intriguing and has a more flushed out storyline than who in the house of dragons has the right to the throne."
"Wow, there's got to be a ton of fake reviews out there to make an 8.5 average rating. This series is BORING! It is micro-focused on a handful of characters with a very low likability value and almost nothing on anything or anyone else. If I have to give a summary, I'd say it's ""men bad, women good, dragons cool""...and that's about it. The plot moves so slowly with the same rhetoric in almost every conversation (succession, succession, succession). This along with long pauses with what's supposed to be meaningful stares off into the distance (or at each other) makes for some really long, uninteresting episodes. And then there's the problem of subbing in supposedly aging characters that is done so poorly you wonder why they did it at all. Season One is simply not very well done, although the special effects are outstanding. Mediocre acting, bad dailogue, poor plotline and a male demeaning narrative makes for some really unappealing, unentertaining viewing. I'm going to forgo Season Two...despite the dragons being cool. I'd rather rewatch GOT. Real Housewives of Westeros."
"The whole episode has more scenes just to shock some really questionable audience than actual story. The same exact strategy was for GOT. Really wanted to admire the effects and see how this story develops but constant brutality and torture is really enough. It has been enough and it should for sure be limited to show so much women torture (among else). It is NOT normal to use it as a tool or scare moment nor it is 'normal for some historical period' and similar nonsense. Never was normal, never will be normal. If we have certain rules to promote diversity in tv and cinema, we should also have rules for violence that is not depicted only with some little number circle in the corner and presented as something usual afterwards. It is simply ridiculous and degrading for this episode as well as any other movie or series that do the same."
The show starts in halfway first of all with no backstory of how viserys dragon balerion died . Too much of time framed skipped by editors. Too much political and change of skins from the originals. It devastating to see such good writing go in waste to such scrutinised video plays and editing. The characters portrayed has no match for the personality the queen and kings are originally described as . If you want free time entertainment of watching just dragons then its your show. Enjoy. Otherwise just skip and flip it ..!! Go read George R R Martin books. Best way to enjoy what and how exactly the characters are.
Watch THE SERPENT QUEEN instead!It has everything House of the Dragon is lacking:
"well-thought-out writtingfast-paced storylinegood actingintrigue & cunninginteresting complex main characterswitty dialoguestructured plotoutstanding costume & hairstyle departmentCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister) even if for 1 episode onlyLet HBO's atrocity sink into oblivion. To dare put this ridiculous nonsensical show out there is beyond me. The only thing left to say about the way they systematically disregard the audience and keep giving us subpar, mediocre shows is: Shame! Shame! Shame!"
"The show suffers from sluggish pacing, lackluster performances, and subpar casting, falling significantly short of the original Game of Thrones. The latter had nearly everything in its rightful place.The casting and acting in this show are disappointing. The chosen actors failed to deliver, lacking the necessary beauty and failing to justify their roles through their performances. The makeup was excessive, resulting in characters that occasionally appeared comical. It seemed as though the show aimed to surpass the original GOT but ultimately failed. Only the last episode held any promise and delivered what viewers were hoping for.Furthermore, the absence of action is noticeable. House of the Dragons lacks the epic battles that were a core strength of Game of Thrones. At times, it feels like the director opted for cost-cutting or a low budget, leading to the omission of significant battles."" 🐉🔥"
"It must be a really daunting task to try to live up to some of the greatest TV in history in Game of Thrones and it shows. Everyone from the props department with their ridiculously bad wigs to the CGI guys are really trying very hard and just about getting there but it is all just nearly there rather than nailing it. The actors are the same, all attempting to live up to the original and in the process falling short. Even Matt Smith and Bill Paterson who have each been treading the boards for years appear uncomfortable and in their character portrayal underwhelming. Hopefully, things will improve.I originally reviewed HOTD at episode 2 and, having given it every chance, I am now at episode 7 and it has just gone from bad to worse! It is incredible that anything based upon such a good book can be so boring but they have managed it. So the Remove Series Link button was used along with Delete."
"By all merits, House of the Dragon is without a doubt a worthy attempt at rekindling the flames GoT extinguished, but it's for this exact reason that the show feels lackluster.The atmosphere is great, that feeling of being back in Westeros but it's missing that spark which the early Seasons of GoT captured, where the world is shown to you through the eyes and words of the characters. It's precisely for this reason why House of the Dragon falls short.If you had no knowledge of Game of Thrones, you would not enjoy House of the Dragon, that's just the way its written. It can not stand on its own and serves as a follow-up prequel to Game of Thrones.The music is phenomenal but again, if you've never seen Game of Thrones, it would not have been as impactful as the show rides that nostalgia.I also feel like a lot of the dialogue is tacky, they're speaking for the sake of just speaking without conveying any meaningful information. The middle to last seasons of GoT was truly guilty of this.Also the sex scenes? Why? It's literally tasteless nudity that serves no purpose. Whereas the sex scenes in GoT serve a purpose. Here the sex scenes are quite simply a show of sexual frustration?All in all, it's ok if you wanna revisit the world of GoT but don't expect that original magic as its long gone, HBO merely want to cash in your nostalgia."
"Let me start by saying I was big fan of GoT, although the final season did feel rushed.But speaking of rushed. The first five episodes jump by two years for each episode, so you feel like you are playing catch up as each episode starts. Episode six jumps 5 years, and it is worth nothing that the king is at deaths door at the end of the episode. Episode seven then jumps another 5 years and the king is still alive, but worse than that, three of the main characters have new actors playing them, as if make up to make the original cast look older is beyond the show. Episode eight then jumps 10years ahead, the king is still alive although barely, while one of the kings table hasn't aged a day since the show started although his mind is going, and the princess's personal guard, who is now the queen's guard has not aged either.This show is awful, one storyline running through the whole show weaving around the Targaryns and the Velaryons. Frequent jumping ahead by years. No humour in the show at all and very predictable. Eight episodes in and I will stick with it to the end now, but definitely won't be back for season 2. I cannot understand why this has been rated so highly when compared to GoT, this looks like it's been thrown together by a bunch of armatures, in a desperate bid by HBO to find another hit show."
This can't beat Game of Thrones...it's very boring ...also its story is a bit drag..... not interesting....awful acting....i cant stand to look at............................................
"Poor poor story, tons of useless and too long speeches ... it' just like that parody the Simpons did of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace... political nonsense stories and words ..on words...with other words... and none of these words catch your attentionWell if you want to see a sud-american telenovelas or some kind of greys anatomy /house of cards drama typology you can go on watching this incredibly boring show.If you you loved Game of Thrones do yourself a favor and keep that amazing show in your head because this thing is goin' to ruin every good memories and feelings you had for GOT."
"Absolutely no clue how much work the original series put into it, this is cheap remake where the dragons look like aliens instead. It tries desperately to be deep and fail miserably.As bad as the lord of the rings remake where the original took an immense amount of work and sacrifice, HBO sucks period.It's about time HBO closes its doors as a company time by time again they shut down great shows like Rome and deadwood.Don't waste your precious time or money on these shows, they're not worth it. They have no originality and is a cheap and desperate attempt to bring home the bacon.It's better to have no remakes than this garbage."
"GoT got slaughtered by many of you followers/fans, after an epic, bewildering tale that captivated us week to week, why, because you didn't get the ending you wished for, it wasn't user friendly enough !? But that was its magic !GoT, like no show I had ever seen, Invested in Characters, then, shocked, created awe & entertained, remember ""The Rains of Castamere"" lol, how many favorites did we lose that night and yet the praise rings loud !You can still embrace it even if it doesn't meet your criteria!As I write HotD has an 8.5 rating on IMDB, yet character investment is limited ? Little shock, very little awe. On it's own merits it is decent but in comparison, not in the same realm. Apologies and eternal gratitude to George R. R. Martin, you created the best thing to ever grace TV screens and I will continue to follow your writings but any of you fans who rate this above the last series of GoT... arrrrggghhh!"
"What to say about this show ? It started relatively well, then after few episodes, you discover that the show has nothing to say.We have to admit that this show will just remain a TV soap opera with easy violence and sex ... like if it needed to ""distract"" the viewer every 10 mins, without these elements the viewer may find time to think at what he is seeing.Daemon Targaryen will probably soon join the Avengers.Even if I don't like to join memes ... the photography is way too dark.No mystery, no fantaisy, just a boring non-sentimental teen-show with some soft porn elements to make the young one happy."
"GOT was good till later seasons came in, and the last episodes was so dark, we could see absolutely nothing. So much anticipation for the winter battle and we got that, shame. Now again they put the same people in charge here on House of the Dragon and we have a lot more dark scenes here, mostly in claustrophobic scenes inside castles. I hate with passion these dark scenes.I don't know why they do that, are they trying to cheapfy something? I was hoping GOT served as lesson how no to do it. Sad.There is so much talk, so much and even with all that they were unsuccessful to build strong characters we care about, worse yet the schemes are not even interesting.Meh. I hope they stop trying to milk this universe."
I'm shocked when I watched episode 6 and saw they fast forwarded time and changed main character for who all the audience got attached!!!!!!! I will not be watching this such a disaster move.The new actress looks too old even older than the queen!!! Destroyed series I was enjoyingI'm shocked when I watched episode 6 and saw they fast forwarded time and changed main character for who all the audience got attached!!!!!!!

"I'm trying really hard to find something to like about this series, but I can't find any. There are subtle references to GoT, it's the only interesting thing about it. Otherwise, there are no arcs, no character development, no WOW factor at the end of every episode, like GoT gave us plenty of. The writing is very average, the story is linear. I had my hopes up, but like every other series done after 2020, none of them has ever shined. This is just another Hollywood trainwreck and it's ruining the legacy of GoT.Even the CGI is mediocre, the dragons with their tiny hind legs are pathetic and wouldn't scare an ant.What puzzles me are the fans giving this high scores! I doubt they are true GoT fans."
"Show really wants you to support the lying cheat Rheanyra. While ruining awesome honest developed characters like Alicent.Actually the last two episodes were already going downhill, where they tried to create sympathy for certain characters and the writing was ruining Alicent's story and portraying her as a villain. While in honesty the sudden switch and favorable writing regarding Rheanyra and her claim suddenly felt disingenuous and i really could 't enjoy the last couple episodes because od this sudden switch. It's like the writings are forcing us to like Rheanyra and portraying her as the lead while she was lying and cheating and murdering her way to the top."
"I would give this a much higher rating IF I COULD ACTUALLY SEE WTF is happening !!!! I can barely see each episode. ""bUt tHAtS tHe wAy tHE LiGhtiNg wAs bACk tHeN!"" I get everything was dark AF in the time period but if you want to make a show that people can ENJOY and get into. THEY NEED TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. I get there's dragons and it's all fantasy so I'm already watching something I know is not real. BUT. I can live in that fantasy reality while I'm watching it. Like we all do when we watch tv or movies or read books. But I can't enjoy anything on a screen if I cannot *literally* see anything. And I'm not letting any online article BS me into believing it's my $600 tv that is the problem."
"I'm like this is the crap I don't like about Hollywood anymore. Trying to project something that's not real but you want it to be. I mean fiction aside but atleast don't put some fake hair on a person that's obviously unbelievable. If you want to show a character, show in their natural form not some made up stuff.I'm like this is the crap I don't like about Hollywood anymore.

"Wow, the producers of this show really did us dirty with this show. Episodes 1-6 is quality TV, but starting with episode 7 they pulled the old switcheroo. Show becomes unwatchable. They must have changed the writers for cheapest, talentless hacks they could find.Dialogue becomes weaker than a Turkish soap opera, tons of ornate old-timey phrasing with no real substance. You don't care about the characters, and neither do the actors. They say their lines, which are grammatically correct, but that's about it. Their lines have no real meaning, like they were produced by a chatbot. There is no character continuity anymore.Plot becomes incredibly dull. The scenes no longer make sense. A guard brutally kills a guest and ruins the royal wedding, next episode he still has his job. The king has his son maimed, his wife attacks his daughter with a knife. What does he say? ""This proceeding is at an end."" What a joke.I wonder what goes through the actors' heads, having signed on to the show only to have the rug pulled from under them and being fed this trash material.What a waste of talent, time and budget."
"And this we've been waiting for?? GoT is ten stars, this is boring, soapoperatic, nothing-happens, talk talk talk, let's see how dark we can film this (ref Ozark), bloodless characters, let's let her sleep with the uncle as that has never been in a script before, no action. Did I say boring? I gave up after ep 5. Even The Power of the Rings were by far better - and that isn't particularly good either...."
"I understand that the new trend in series is to build tension as the seasons roll, so it can only get better - though I have my doubts. I'll jump to season 5-6 or whenever they plan to end it."
"After some wonderful acting and great cast choice in the first few episodes you really begin to know these characters... Alas then there is a time skip, your actors have changed, and the spark isn't there.. this series could've gone well if they tried to flesh the characters out before jumping a few episodes in. The story was pretty good for what we got but it still comes down to that time skip, it really ruined it for me.Without a doubt my favourite actor in this is Paddy Considine, not only because you could feel the pain he was going through in the end. But because he was the one constant in the episodes. Matt Smith done well with the screen time he had and Milly Alcock was probably one of the most easy to understand characters within the world of house of the dragon and game of thrones TV series."
"I got about ninety percent through the first episode and gave up. The acting was okay, the costumes and sets looked great, CGI was good and really brought the dragons to life. I'd give it four stars on that alone. The problem was that it's pretty much all violence porn, and what isn't violence porn is just porn porn. It's like they dumped a bunch of writers into a room with the only instruction being to come up with the sickest, most vile content possible and then passed that on to their special effects people. It's graphic, gruesome, and not nearly enough story there. I feel bad for Matt Smith. His taste in projects post Dr. Who has made him a performer I no longer seek out, but this? I have to wonder if this role isn't career suicide."
"I feel somewhat sorry for paddy considine and Matt Smith, they carried the whole series on their shoulders. The female cast were all generally weak and very poorly cast especially Emma D'Arcy, I find her terribly overrated and looks absolutely nothing like Milly alcock. I have very high hopes for the second season, Matt Smith will need the support of the younger generation to carry this season as I fear the rest of the cast especially Ewan Mitchell, all the young cast have a lot to offer. It was on the whole quite confusing to start, but the variations of the dragons was a good twist but this bonding with dragons was a bit weird."
"The first episode is an absolute disappointment. The dragons looks like cartoon, CGI sucks and the casting sucks. Wait and her this, nope that cant be a got spin off ðŸ‘Ž"
"Where do i start?? Ignore the HATERS, this show is on track to be BETTER than the original. The show opened right away with severed limbs and castration, i said to myself; ""Welcome back to Westeros baby!"" And pumped my fist. The show just kept getting better from there, perfectly placed sex and violence to satisfy any GoT fan. Now let's get to the casting. I can't get enough of Patty Constantine as the King! The haters might say, ""he looks like he could be a manager at a Home Depot in Little Rock Arkansas"" but maybe you just have no taste?? And don't get me started on the Valariens. My jaw dropped when they first appeared on screen, simply stunning costumes and nearly impossible to see the wigs lifting off their scalps with the glue strands blowing in the wind. And the CGI! The CGI would rival even the best Marvel production and that's saying something! (She-Hulk, anyone?)"
"One of my favorite scenes was when sir Kristen Cole and Raneera were in the woods and hear a shuffling nearby, and out came a boar (so real i actually had to google if the boar was real or CGI) charging from the bush and sent Cole flying!! Absolute genius setup and just the sense of humor I expect from a GoT production. And how about that crab episode people COME ON! Like are you KIDDING ME? They were in a war with the crab people for TWO years straight, badass hunk Damon is fed up and is like ""you know what? F$@& this, I'm doing things MY way"" charges in there, dodges 10,000 arrows and emerges from the cave carrying the torso of the Crab King single handed lay ending the war! Folks, it doesn't get more badass than that!! Had to pump my fist again to that one. Would I liked to have seen a showdown with Damon and the Crab King? No. You know why? It would be too much! I don't want to be over-indulged, leave that fan service crap to the Star Wars crowd. This show actually has class and self awareness, thank you very much. Now so many are complaining about the time jump saying why recast the two main actresses but keep everyone else? I wouldn't expect simpletons to understand but I'll just say this; the writers are playing chess, the rest of you are playing checkers. To wrap this up, ignore these negative nancies and strap yourself in because you're in for a wild ride! Revisit this review in a couple years when HotD is praised for the masterpiece it truly is and you'll see I was right all along."
"George RR Martin was essentially a laughing stock in the fantasy world. He relied upon heavy sexual violence and cheap deaths to propel his writings.Well.... If he's truly a part of this series, then it's clearly still cheap and blah.Honestly, if I can feel MORE for a 10-min character in a cheap scifi/fantasy Warhammer book by Dan Abnett than I feel for a single one of these cheap, CW character? Well, it's sad.I wanted to enjoy it more.I gave 4 stars because it's not entirely terrible, but who can truly care about any show where nobody cares about anyone by the end? I mean, it's just bad storytelling. Of COURSE we all want to love the dragons and have more, but genuinely. After the first episode, what were we left with that didn't rely upon the successful original and it's lore?"
"Too much empty dialogue. Everyone is devoid of emotion except the two characters I gave a star for. Two great actors for two great characters. The lack of emotion makes the blood shedding uninteresting. There aren't any charming female characters so far, which is disgusting and pointless for a show with so much feminism charged (at least for now).There are a lot of foul decisions at the creative level, such as saying that having sex as a teen makes women barren, which is absolutely detouched from reality. I understand why there is this urban legend going on from teen dramas and the such, but not in an adult series. Or how no one batted an eye when some high rank knights were killed for no reason, that suspension of reality makes imposible to keep watching the show focused.The suspension of reality is the main problem with the show, too many incoherences with reality and how actual human beings react."
"It doesn't appear to bring anything new to the GoT world. Power plays interspersed with sex & violence same story different actors. GoT was better being the first of its kind. Well made, beautifully photographed, the characters are re-hashed versions of everything that was in GoT. The themes and stories were what made GoT novel and interesting; this appears to be just more of the same."
"This is happen only Latino TV shows to change the actors , I feel disappointed! Massive GOT fan here so went in with high expectations. One of the things I really enjoyed about the original show was the political and personal intrigue between the characters and they were a fascinating, multi-dimensional lot. There were lots of favourites, ones that I loved and those I loved to hate and that happened right from the start. I don't like the the new actor of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen Emma D'Arcy . I watched every episode with big interest before you change the actors The other is I don't see any serious battles only in the of the beginning."
"Unnecessary scenes of traumatic births from the fatally gruesome c section in very first episode, to the scene in which the baby is breech and can't be delivered leading to laena killling herself, rhaenyra bleeding on the way to the queen after shortly giving birth and then the still birth in finale.I just think it's ridiculously graphic and hard to watch as a mother and very scary for an expectant mother. It's every parents nightmare for any of those outcomes.There is so many other ways that their terrible tragedy could have been acted out. If their trying to recreate the shock factor of Ned starks be heading they will never be able to.I think it's highly insensitive to grieving families out there. A lot of tv shows have warnings for sensitive topics and offers helpline numbers at the end I think they should be made to do this when airing the show.Such a weak, predictable and boring storyline it would have taken two episodes to tell the whole story in game of thrones, it's a waste of time and money, I feel bad for the actors because they are talented."
"I gave House of Dragon a go. I did not like the first episode as it was full of the GOT format I didn't care for. I thought it was getting better a few more episodes, particularly with the character and story development in the beginning, which seemed a little more consistent and you can actually care a bit more about a few of the characters.But that was shortly lived, it started to be as ridiculous as GoT, characters change and behave randomly despite their past experience and perceived well/worse for whatever suited the narrative for the episode. The alliances between factions make no sense given what some characters did to members of their families and people that they cared for a minute ago.Same soap opera crap, weak story and characters, full of sensationalist tactics with dragons and medieval aesthetics thrown in to make you think it's a fantasy.There's only one character left I could maybe get, the rest of them are I really don't care for watching."
This show can be summarized as a mellow dramatic soap opera with some dragons. Boring characters with blank mellow dramatic acting. With alots of blood and cringy exchanges that I'm sure the creators would think was edgy and sexy. The exception might be young Reneris. But even she gives up her powerful demeanor to whining. But the random storyline set her up alittle too. It fluctuates between vague emotional monologues and obvious banter. It's like the writers were in separate rooms. Too much dialog flanked with over the top fight sequences. The timeline speeds through leaving no time to be invested in the story. Costumes are cool though..
"This show started off ok and for me, it went down hill as the season went on. In general though there wasn't anything to grab onto, which likely has something to do with them using different actors for some characters as they age.The story was dull and often confusing, the lighting was awful, it can be night time in movies without having extended scenes that are so dark that you can only make out occasional arms, legs and maybe a face. I was happy to make it to the end of season 1, I will probably watch one or two episodes of season 2 in hopes it is better.This show is like a half hearted version of Game of Thrones. I found it to be barely watchable."
"I know now why some reviews were scathing of the acting - it's the.""center of your head"", soap opera ADR type sound that's the culprit.There is little depth or perspective in the sound design to complement the imagery. And the sound scapes seem to be too uniform as scenes change.Yes the voice delivery seems a little flat too, like reading scripts instead of being absorbed in the part.I'm sure the GOT fans will lap it up, and it's not unusual for the woodenness in a new series to fade out, but it's not a good look for starters. And the reviewers giving it a 9 or 10 are kidding themselves.Lets hope that it's like a good red wine: rough when young & improves with age.(Edited - wrong number of stars on first draft - I always meant to be restrained on this.)"
"There's no way HOTD could get so many reviews and especially on single episodes. The reviews of HBO shows always get distorted, 'cause HBO sets only one episode online in a week, so the reviews stack. Which means one person writes one review per episode.But besides that:"
The show's story really started in episode 6. Which is too late. The CGI is ok. But CGI isn't everything. Show's have to start to build their story in first episodes. And this show failed with that. HOTD messes everything up with time jumps and always changing characters. Some characters are great but most are poorly written. 1/10.
"After watching first episode, I was really looking forward. But after watching next two episodes, I have my doubts. I have a feeling, this is going to sink episode by episode. I am not able to connect with any character's storyline. So far I like Dameon, Rhaenyra but not enough to care what happens to them. It's hard to explain but I am not looking forward to the next episode. It's like if I miss to watch it on Sunday, I can watch it in few days. The anticipation is not nearly great as GOT. Something is missing.The CGI is good. The costumes and production design are top notch. The background score needs solid improvement. The actors are good and doing their job. But the script and writing needs improvement.After having watched four episodes, I feel this is not going to end well.Overall solid 4/10."
"Firstly, this is nothing compared to Game of Thrones.If you go into this expecting Game of Thrones then you'll be really disappointed, it's actually more a political drama. Being a political drama isn't in itself a bad thing but it does become too much, it's sick making to watch all the betrayals after a few episodes it does become dull.No one is good no one is honourable, at least not for long, they are either murdered or seemingly forget they were ever honourable in the first place. I lost count of the amount of people who abandoned all of their principles seemingly with the changing of the breeze.It should be highlighted that Olivia Cooke plays a truly disgusting character, completely vile in everyway. She plays it very well, too well, I liked her as an actor in the past but I'm afraid that will be tainted by just how disgusting she is in this.I suppose this might be a fairly decent reflection of politics today, with all the backstabbing but without as much bloodshed, which as a thought is incredibly depressing."
"All this posturing about power- should be an exciting subject. Instead this is a House of boring people, who are not helped by sluggish writing. So many Lord this, Ser that and Lady so-and-so come and go with little impact on the plot. And the look of the production is just plain cheap looking. Perhaps the omnipresent dim lighting is trying to hide the fact that there's nothing to look at. I seldom found GOT slow; on those rare occasions there was usually something interesting to view. And I didn't have to struggle to see what was on the screen.It's apples and oranges of course, but visually alone, the Rings of Power is light years ahead of this series. It's full of brilliant visuals that are filled with beauty and wonder. Is the plot better? I'm not so sure yet, but it seems like a lot more more fun."
"Was looking forward to this but on watching the first episode I realised it was missing a LITTLE something. Surprised that they missed the SMALLEST of detail making this a huge flop in my opinion.Had they managed to include just a MINISCULE of thought it might have turned out great. But they decided to LIMIT it and ended up with a MEAGER offering of NO HEIGHT and MODEST series on a SMALL-SCALE.Such a SLIGHT error ended up with a PALTRY, MINIATURE offering of INSUFFICIENT and LIMITED SCANTINESS that I was unable to continue with any of the following episodes.Such a shame that TV has been REDUCED to this LOW level of entertainment."
"The show is okay. Right when I started getting into they switched up the characters. There isn't a lot that happens in this show that matters which makes some of the scenes mind numbing. Lots of pointless sex scenes, like a lot lot. For no reason. Lots of walking and talking. Three or four very graphic pregnancy scenes. Very little action or dragons in the first six episodes.The show looks good and the casting is okay but most of the show is filler. You can miss significant portions of this show and not miss anything because it's mostly filler anyway. It's good by todays standard of shows but the rating does not make sense to me at all.Now that I've finished all of its even dumber. Like literally nothing happens. Barely any dragons at all. They are less than a side character. Over all episodes maybe a 10 minute compilation. They mostly land and fly off."
"I think there is a clear bias in creating women's as the heroes of the serie and pulling the rug out from under the feet of all the males in the story. As I see it the advocates of wisdom and prudence until now were : Alicent from the Greens camp, at the time when her father and children are being idiots"
"On the other hand, Reanera also represents the voice of reason in the black camp, and Daemon being the one that act unrationally"
"And between the two camps Rhaenys the queen who never was , and who could have annihilated the greens and end the whole story, but she said that this is a war is not hers to begin with.The writer gave all the wisdom to women and did not leave a man of justice in the Series... The king is weak and biased ... and his brother is reckless and selfish.... Elisent's sons are one a drunken womanizer and the other is evil... And Raenera children are still small, shaky and afraid... Maybe the older one began to feel responsible, even the family of Rhaenys, the son, is irresponsible, and the father is obsessed with power and does not have the slightest amount of responsibility, leaving Rhaenys to face all the pressure alone.... Feminist writing has changed a lot of the ideas of George R. R. Martin, and she is giving us a meal that taste like ice and fire, right, but with a different taste..... a woman's taste"
What you think?
"Besides all of the obvious things wrong with this show, which I will list out the man one, simply because of the required characters for a review, which doesn't seem to be a requirement for everyone. Wokeism... yea, its in here, unfortunately, like anything out of hollywood these days. Thats ok, I just laugh at that junk, and it only makes the shows even worse, and reduces their viewership. But, the bottom line is this. This is no Game of Thrones. There isn't a single likable character in the show. You wont find any Arya Stark's here. It's just another mediocre production. I'm surprised George RR Martin allowed it, although maybe he is out of the picture now."
"We can pretty much guess what's going to happen after watching the 1st episode.The acting is rushed. Very little to no character development. At times it's like flicking through a social feed, moving from one titillation to the next.I found myself getting fed up with the gratuitous sex and violence. It's getting tiring. It's old. It's crude. It's a lousy substitute for better acting and better character development.Another aspect of the fighting scenes is the unbelievable way in which fights just seem to go on and on. I could not help wondering if this series could be done in a lot fewer episodes.Overall, disappointing in the extreme."
"I recently watched a show called hOuSe Of ThE dRaGoN that had a 2:1 aspect ratio and it was extremely frustrating. The format made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the content as the picture felt cramped and the visual elements were not as impactful as they could have been. Instead of feeling like I was fully transported into the world of the show, I was constantly aware of the aspect ratio and how it was affecting my viewing experience.One of the most frustrating aspects of the 2:1 aspect ratio was how it affected the way the characters and settings were portrayed on screen. The horizontal field of view felt constricted, and it was difficult to get a sense of the scale and scope of the world. This was especially noticeable in scenes where the characters were moving through large, open spaces. The cramped aspect ratio made these scenes feel claustrophobic and uninviting, rather than expansive and immersive.In addition to the visual limitations of the aspect ratio, I also found that it affected the way I was able to connect with the characters. Close-up shots of the actors' faces felt cramped, and it was difficult to see the subtle facial expressions and emotions that are so crucial to understanding the characters. This made it harder to become fully invested in their stories and to care about what was happening to them.Overall, the aspect ratio negatively impacted my viewing experience and I would not recommend this show to others. While the story and acting were good, the 2:1 aspect ratio was a major distraction and detracted from the overall enjoyment of the show. I would hope that in future productions, the creators and producers will consider how the aspect ratio can enhance or detract from the viewing experience and make a more thoughtful decision when choosing the format."
"Watch this show if you can't go to sleep. It will bore you out of your mind and it gets depressing too. Bad acting overall, the writing even worse i think i quit watching after 8 episodes. The characters have zero backstory and character arc. The beginning was promising, and that was it. It lives nowhere near the first GOT.Also it has cringe drama like my bf becomes daddys wife.And princess falls in love with her boring as brick protector.This tv show it's clearly a cheap parody compared to the first series. If you compare this to a show like the Gladiators our Vikings this is a joke, and should be under a category comedy."
"Quick update: I'm now at episode 5 and when speaking to my sister about which shows I'm watching on HBO, and I totally forgot I was watching this. That's how forgettable this show is.So, the story of House of the Dragon takes place about 200 years before GoT, and personally I can feel that, but not in a good way.The series starts with exposition about who's gonna rule when the king dies a man or a woman, and surprise! It the woma... No it's the man. I got no problem with that, but where Game of Thrones was shocking, and kept you on the edge of your seat each week! This feels bland and uninteresting.I literally couldn't care less if they killed the main character at this point, because I don't care about any of these people.I've also been taken a bit away with the dragons in the show. Not the much the design, I quickly got used to the very long neck and fishy kind of tail on the red dragon. But I don't feel like they blend in as good as they did in GoT. This could be because the budget is smaller for this show but I don't know.I'm probably gonna keep watching the season, but if they don't start turning down the political BS, and start bringing some character for me to care about, that's probably all I'm gonna watch.If you have high expectations for the show, I would say kill them like they killed Oberyn Martellin in GoT, because it will not live up to that.If you have no expectations, then yeah, I'd recommend... I'd recommend just watching Game of Thrones because then you probably didn't watch that ðŸ˜‰"
"Targeting the same people that finds no excitement whatsoever in real life but are not currently treated or confined in an appropriate clinic, the series also has a childish story that not fits at all the previous statements. To be clear, I am not blaming the producers and/or viewers but I definitely don't want to interact with neither.On the good side of things, there is some good acting and costumes but the fighting scenes are always filmed so you cannot see a thing (so... bad).If you are a fan of blood and gore (without any common sense sometimes) then this is a show for you.For me is just a waste of time."
Only 13 minutes in and they have to use the F word... by Young Princess Rhaenyra in disdain for her teacher no less. We already know she has a rebellious streak... and later the C word. Guess I'm too old for this poor quality immature script. At 20 M an episode I'd rather see the money go into homeless housing or food stability projects. I'll donate the cost of the bag of chips I won't be eating watching this! And why isn't IMDb giving it an age rating?
"They just wanted to destroy Game of Thrones in our minds. The first 30 minutes were too harsh and too much for viewers like us to see this much madness, and I'm totally surprised why they allowed this piece of s**t to be shown on television.I watched all series and movies of this type, like The Last Kingdom, The Vikings, and Game of Thrones, but they never tear down a pregnant lady in front of all viewer's eyes. They just need to show that the king didn't choose his wife; there is no need to show everything. Cutting heads, smashing faces and slaughtering soldiers are so common, and we all can handle it because we love this type of series, but slaughtering an awake pregnant woman is not what we expect to see on television.I watched GOT 3 times, and I was waiting for this peace of nothing for years, but I'm totally disappointed, and I feel discussed, and I stopped to watch it and will tell everyone not to watch it as an act of protest.Shame... Shame... Shame..."
"Well, people, from now on i take my words about Game of Thrones start back(like s1 or so), cause this TV series is far more lame, dull, empty, poor on the stories and cool characters, but this thing moreover is so santa barbaric and sugar that it is just impossible to watch. The only characters that made sense are hands of king(ok and Larys Strong), and the thing is, they are not doing anything except being reasonable and partly noble. In Game of Thrones start, we had Ned Freaking Stark, mature tone and dirt, and here we have cosplay, wanna be series. If you don't believe my word, just check out the weak king that we have here and how lucky he has such a good court compared to GoT(in sense of loyalty and qualification) and it is strange, cause the king is weak and unwise, i believe in Game of Thrones this guy would not live that long. And i could also say a few things about characters (un)development, about their aging too fast(or not at all, or not looking natural), about useless scenes where kid flies on the dragon, just to show you graphics(to my opinion, even graphics not impressive at all). To be honest, i got general impression that i'm watching some kind of fan fiction theatre or so, i didn't have suspension of disbelief even for a moment. No twist, no interesting events. Dummy."
"After Game of Thrones I was looking forward to this show; the first few episodes were promising BUT then the time jumps, from then on it was a losing battle, then ANOTHER time jump. Some actors were kept, other were changed for older ones; it seems that whoever was in charge of casting forgot to read the script ""spoiler"" how can you have an age difference of just a year or two between the actors playing mother and son?The lighting was bad, you had to rely on voice recognition.Now for the dragons, again they kept forgetting how big they were meant to be as each frame the size changed.All in all disappointing; and I gave a 5, the reason was for the first few episodes and I was feeling generous."
"If the first 5 episodes had continued on this would have easily been a 9 or 10/10. The writing and acting was absolutely terrific. The ways the characters all meshed together while creating a tense yet exciting storyline was phenomenal.The problem with this series, however, lies in the Episode 6 and beyond. New actors and actresses playing roles performed by much better actors and actresses from Episodes 1-5, new characters that do little to nothing to further the storylines, and new situations that also offer nothing but filler for the next season (which I don't think I'll watch because the acting from Episodes 6-10 was so atrocious).This series should have stuck with the same storylines and actors/actresses from Episodes 1-5...everything after that is garbage. So much potential wasted.5/105 stars for the first 5 episodes. 0 stars per episode after that."
"I have to say it, i'm sorry if you think bad of me but the black Targaryns are so badly costumed and made up that it just turns any scene they are in into a complete comedic meme for me.Otherwise, this is a solid show with actors learning their lanes in early episodes much like with the original series. This era of the lore is rife with intrigue, deception and opportunities for great story telling.With some time jumps and more jumps coming sometimes a second watch can help with picking up the unsaid cues.The imagery is fantastic minus the aforementioned issue, some world building and expansion of areas of westeros that were glossed over in the original is nice. Watching houses in their infancy gives a new light to the whole world of westeros.Overall it's watchable and good escapism TV, heaps better than THE RINGS OF POWER: MARY SUE EDITION.I'll keep watching and hoping this gets to be a staple in my library to rewatch again over the years."
"House of the Dragon is not a worthy prequel to Game of Thrones. Just like the latter part of Game of Thrones, all of Season 1 of House of the Dragon felt like HBO did not want to do the series.The first 8 episodes are incredibly boring, even more boring than. Amazon's Rings of Power. You keep waiting for something to happen, and when it does, there is no surprise in it. There is almost no real tension, the intrigues are obvious and the acting mundane. There just really is not an actor or character that stands out, there is nobody sympathetic, it is just plain awful.The CGI effects are often mediocre and are reminiscent of 20 year old tech.If you have watched GoT, then you already know who the survivors can't be. That really whittles down the surprises.At least opening credit scene is probably going to improve. It can't be worse."
"The series with Game of Thrones cannot even be compared, these films are of completely different levels. If in Game of Thrones you plunged into the world of the Middle Ages and believed what was happening on the screen, then in this tabloid play everything is quite the opposite. It feels like the actors were selected on the street, according to the criterion who will ask less money for participating in the series, they play disgusting, it is impossible to watch. Children in kindergarten are even more convincing. The selection of actors also leaves much to be desired, one of the main roles (the king's daughter), how much I understand before in the royal families strictly followed the purity of the breed and from generation to generation and they should at first glance have aristocratic features, the daughter absolutely does not correspond to her role, well, there is nothing aristocratic in her profile, her place, judging by her blunt expression, is more likely on a peasant farm to look after animals and not in the palace. The only reason why they could take her on the role is from tolerance, only to not offend sexual minorities due to which the film lost a lot in quality. It's not clear with my uncle what kind of nonsense is this? It seems that the actor just likes films about elves and he decided to dress up as an elf like it looks cool, it looks like a juvenile idiot who did not play enough in childhood, and here the elves seem to be in the film about them a word and he judging by the film is a man once uncle princess. The role of African Americans was also not incomprehensible in the film Game of Thrones, so where did they come from in the prequel? Again out of a sense of tolerance so as not to offend? In the Middle Ages, African Americans did not show their noses from their continent and no one in other countries heard about them. The actors play weakly, there are no characters, the film is like a cheap tabloid production, outright muck and complete disappointment, sorry for the time spent, I was able to watch only until episode 4, but after I changed the actors (main characters), I could no longer watch this Santa Barbara."
"Ever watch a movie that has so much hype and followed the Game of Thrones, expectations ofcourse are high. Each episode expectating something exciting then nothing but mindless gore not even good acting then changing actors with unconvincing older likenesses. The whole time expectations of some kind of entertainment was willfully lacking right to the lackluster end. Hope HBO cuts and runs or replace the films entire series with a new version that can become a great series like GOT but they won't it's hype will carry enough to draw viewers who will then lower any future expectations from HBO. Wake up HBO deliver greatness not drabble."
"Do I enjoy House of the Dragon? Not really. Name the reasons? Slow, predictable.Will I watch it til the end? Yes, if a season has ended, and fast-forward will get me quicker to good stuff.The only good actor with style is Rhys Ifans. Milly Alcock walk and behaves like an American teenager.Nothing feels right: 200 years before GoT? No technical progress so for the next 200 years, same weapons in GoT and HotD.I watched GoT Season 1 to 3 last week. My mouth again stood wide open a lot. What ideas! What a cast! What an athmosphere!Why they didn't identified the success parameters of Game of Thrones?a lot of different houses, with special character?away from standard villain / good wo:men?characters you can call so, not stereotypesYes, GoT was and stays exceptional, and I dont expected it 10/10 (ok, I hoped for, but ..)"
I dont see why they see the need to put these vulgar sex scenes into the show...they can give the message without it being so explicit. I did not sign up to watch porn. It is really unnecessary and takes away. I would've gave a 7 if it wasnt for the soft porn that is just over done and screams desperate. Like all that is not necessary to sell the show. Pathetic. Quite frankly a turn off especially when good story going then randomly inserts long drawn out sex scenes...like why?! Random no name girl gets raped. Her face is not even shown but they focus forever on explicitly showing the sex act of rape and then moves on. It's like ok that's distracting and you didnt need all that to make a point. I would've given a 7 if it wasnt for the soft porn. Everything else was decently done. Nothing to rave about but leaves you curious. I hope they dont try to throw any political agendas into the show. I really do. A good start that could've been better minus the soft porn.
"Those Targaryens should invest in some candles. Half of the time you can't see what the hell is going on, not that there's much going on anyway. Also I find myself wandering off and doing other things like writing this review during an episode. That's clearly not a good sign. I keep hoping things pick up and that it's all for the better in the end, cause right now it's just a soap opera. I also didn't like the recasting in the middle of the season. Milly Alcock was one of the bright points in my opinion. The actress replacing her is only a few years older, so it doesn't make much sense either. They could've done something with makeup I guess. Anyway I hate not seeing her as Rhaenyra. As I said I hope it picks up cause right now it's just not that good."
"Valyrians are pale white with silver hair and purple/blue/green eyes. Not just white, pale white. Not just Targaryens, all Valyrians.Dark-skinned people come from The Summer Isles and Naath, not Essos.These two were boldly mentioned in books and the show but they ruined the show with making lord Velaryon and his descendents black. No one would complain if characters like blood and cheese and Marston Waters were black. However a black velaryon is silly.A world of Ice and Fire is based on medieval Europe, specifically Westeros. The whole point to the alieness and strangeness to the Targaryens is that they are a pale, white haired , purple eyed race from Essos(Asia) that tamed dragons. They are obsessed with keeping their bloodline pure so much that they marry brother to sister. When the 12 year old Velaryon girl says she will give him many pure blooded Targaryen children I nearly spit out my drink. I'm all for racial diversity in casting but this makes no sense. You have two whole other continents and the summer Isles to cast those with a darker skin tone."
"This is my first review and I have watched until the unfortunate sixth episode. And I just say NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! HOW COULD YOU? Everyone responsible for changing the actors mid season? So you literally can spend on advanced CGI and not makeup/CGI making the actors seem younger/older? This show is so extremely much slower and shallow than GOT. And I bought it. Because I literally can do without the exceptional marvels that made GOT legendary. But this decision was like twisting the knife that stabbed us during the last season of GOT. I'm loyal, I'm understanding, I'm foremost easy to please. But this was too much."
"The production of this show is expectional. Great clothes and scenery. However, unlike the first series in the story, which had mulitple plots going on at the same time, this series seems locked into just one --court intrigue. That makes it drag a bit and border on boring at times. It also is a familiar tale of what does happen at a royal court, so the events to come are foretold; you can see them coming. I never knew what would happen on. Game of Thrones; where we would travel throughout the kindgom and into other storylines. Still, I enjoy the possibilities of this series, despite the blloody river running throughout the intro, seeming to go nowhere other than more blood. Perhaps that is its single plot, killings and more killings. I hope not."
"In comparison to the original Game of thrones this is very poor. I would only give one star because of the dragons and the daemon performance..... how could you change the princess like that.... and replace it with completely different actress in everything..... I regret watching it.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Action is reduced..... the story is reduced..... not many interesting things to watch for.... the end is easy to predict with what I see from here.... i was really expecting more but im very very disappointed from what I see... this thing cant keep much of my attention on it, lord of the rings is way better and to the story than this bs."
"House of dragons is a terrible show with terrible season 1 ending.. Incomplete storyline, imperfect scenarios.. The just made this show especially to anger the viewers.. Not watching this show will make anybody's life a thousand times better.."
"It is just like the messed up last few episodes of Game of thrones but the complete show is trash.House of dragons is a terrible show with terrible season 1 ending.. Incomplete storyline, imperfect scenarios.. The just made this show especially to anger the viewers.. Not watching this show will make anybody's life a thousand times better.."
It is just like the messed up last few episodes of Game of thrones but the complete show is trash.
"But my real question is to some of the reviewers. What's up with the ""woke"" word? You don't like Corliss? You know that family is in the books, right, inexplicably left out of GOT. His daughter? What did you think she should look like? I don't understand this viewpoint, go back to tv in the 1950s. As for the show itself I'm waiting for it to develop. I like the king but wonder why anyone would fear him. Matt smith is not an evil person but maybe a psycho? I like both of the main girls but who doesn't see the ""complexity"" of that relationship. The whole of the small council needs to be filled out, right now they are not too deep. Too many ""easy"" things happening; the king killing his wife, cmon, then the boy dieing, the king not disciplining his brother more earnestly, the brother in law being more wealthy than the king. I need to start seeing more. The coming attractions for next week didn't give me a lot of hope, just more questions."
"The story is good! It was a pity in the first few minutes of the first episode that I became suspicious that they had tampered with it. I went online to check (I haven't read the books yet, but I want to because I believe they have the same potential as A Song of Ice and Fire), and, unfortunately, I confirmed that they had usurped the physical characteristics of one of the families following a way of acting that is often seen nowadays in the film industry... Until the last episode of the season, I could not abstract from the mop heads, which spoiled the whole experience. Surely it would be a seven or an 8 eight that could increase in the following seasons, but no.Compared with Game of Thrones, I think this first season follows a pace similar to 4th and following seasons of Game of Thrones, I mean, a fast pace. Taking into account that it is a new story, in a different time with different characters, it should be better to have a slower pace to involve us deeper in the ambiance, and the story. But I understand the high competition nowadays, and the pace it imposes."
Is house of dragon an ok show? Yes
Is it a good show? Maybe
Otherwise it is nothing more than a POSSIBlE good show
With a very slow repetitive story in 1st 3 episodes the show starts with a boring dull act from young princess Rhaenyra to a one path progress of storytelling (how to ascend a female to throne)
"Compared to GOT, the house of dragon is a baby show with superficial content and conflicts. Just couple of dragons flying, no major war scenes, no complex characters"
The show is only saved by act of king viserys(paddy considine) and lady princess rhaenyra (emma darcy).No go for House dragon.
"I'm gonna have trouble watching to the end of S1 E1. Twenty minutes in, it's pure cardboard franchise reputation exploitation. Plot, acting, writing, design, photography, music... all third-rate. Not even an interesting face to be seen. Two minutes of the opening credits of Game of Thrones was more entertaining than what I've seen so far. Much more entertaining.George RR Martin ran out of steam after the first three volumes of A Song of Ice and Fire, and this clunker makes me fear the last of his moxie is gone.Hoping against hope that House of the Dragon will miraculously rise above its mind-numbing first quarter hour, back I go...Yay! Stuff starts to happen. At the end, every minute has about 15 seconds worth of action. I raise my rating to *** Lousy, but probably not an intentional insult to viewers."
"In the first episode, probably within the first 20 minutes, we saw a man's hand chopped off, a man's head chopped off, several men have their faces smashed during a jousting match, and got to view a woman having her unborn child cut out of her womb. This level of violence is intollerable to me. The producers at HBO seem to think that gratuitous cruelty is the gateway to success. I disagree.If the opening episode is a harbinger of things to come then we can expect a thinly diguised endoresement of authoritarianism and intolerance. The King is cut off from his subjects. He is not curious about the world around him, He relies on the opinions of his most depraved advisors. He is a terrible ruler and totally unsympathetic.This episode appeals to the most depraved instincts of the audience. It is upsetting and without merit. I will not watch the series."
"Some very bland acting with actors not fitting their role, in particular Paddy Considine as King Targaryan, simply did not feel/act regal and had no strong screen presence, Matt Smith as Daemon started with evil intent then just faded away with no real direction. Others played their part with Graham McTavish standing out for me and to a lesser extent Fabian FrankelThe storyline, although linear, seemed to waste too much time on idle chit chat, one episode filled with an actor pathetically dying the entire episode and even skipping areas where the plot could have been used to grab you and jumping forward in time (you work that out yourself as nobody ages except the children). Speaking of plot, sorry, there seems little substance there either. More like a soapie with some swearing and soft porn to excite the desperate.Aside from the usual CGI for both the back grounds and dragons, I rarely felt there was any big build up or excitement to keep me yearning for the next episode."
"Really reminded me of GoT.. after it got bad. I'll keep watching the series but so far I have way more criticism than praise.Just in terms of the quality of the show. All the action and effects are there, some great actors, its just let down by pretty poor writing and script. This show was just like GoT in that regard, it was nowhere near as good as GoT was in its beginning seasons. More so near the end when it seems like about 5 minutes goes into writing the script and plot.The first large problem with the show is that no character is even a little bit likeable, it became a media trend to talk about how the guy who was suppose to be a baddie was a fan favorite. That's how little any character resonated with the audience. I'll agree Daemon was my favorite just because you can count on something crazy happening, but it's not like I have any affection for him. If he gets taken out in the next season I wouldn't really care. That is one thing GoT did exceedingly well is built up characters as 'good' characters whom you felt sad or upset when they were killed off. Daddy stark would have been the prime example, or had John Snow been killed, or the effect the 'red wedding' had. Again near the ending of GoT this took a stark downturn, to where Daenarys has a random character development - turning exactly into her dad, out of exactly nowhere.. Just as little thought went into her character development as any character in this series. The only character development is making the characters extremely unlikeable but even that is inconsistent. Alicent is a prime example - spend 3-4 episodes making her look evil and mean, show 5 seconds of her being nice randomly. Rinse and repeat. Happened twice, once when she suddenly wanted to be best buds with Rhaenyra again, and when she suddenly is shocked everyone wants to kill Rhynera after she has already decided to steal the throne from her.. Both instances made zero sense. Whatver the dudes name is that is alicents little slave, the knight, that dudes character is completely ruined. It made no sense for him to continue as a knight after murdering a dude in public. Meanwhile they show another knight getting fired for a much lesser offense.By far the biggest annoyance I have with the show, even more than its subpar writing, is the random a$$ casting changes. Characters go from being older than each other to younger from one episode to the next, while some characters don't age at all. Just compare the age of Rhayneara to her cousins on any given episode. First episode shes in the womb and they're already alive, then she's older, then they catch up, then he's older. It's like a back and forth.. She ages into a woman while alicent doesn't age at all? Her aunt and uncle and dad don't age? Like who came up with this bull and why? How did nobody realize how little sense any of it made? People seem to be so confused by this.. No it's fine they changed characters, it's just not fine that they changed them inconsistently. If they couldn't manage to do it with sense, then don't do it at all."
"For those who thought Game of Thrones went astray, or never quite lived up to its potential, this is a chance at redemption. Many more subtleties, many more dragons, much more infighting. So much subtlety that I'm not quite sure who all the characters are, where they stand, or what they thought happened at certain points. If you are a detail-oriented hardcore fan, this is a plus. If you're more casual, like me, it's a bit annoying. I gave up on subtleties after all the unresolved lines in GoT, and I'm still bitter about it.Acting, casting, worldbuilding, special effects...all top notch. Wouldn't surprise me if many of GoT major players behind the scenes are working their magic again.Time jumps are annoying. I struggled to track which adult characters translated to which child character after the jump, especially since their names are similar...their looks are similar...their personalities are similar...almost like family.After the finale, which was quite good, I kind of get the time jumps. If they truly took their time with it, they'd lose everyone in seasons of backstory before the real action in season 5. Now we should see real action in season 2, and I'm looking forward to it.This series has a lot of potential, just like Game of Thrones did. I intend to revisit this review after each season and add a star if it's living up to its potential."
"Instead of focusing on doing more, better, stronger, HBO chose the safe coccoon of what we all know and love, including the music theme.What could have been another epic adventure feels cheap, hurried and bleak. Almost an abomination. Imagine going to the best pizza place in NY just to get some preheated leftovers.The need for money is killing this industry."
"The use of violence is just too much. The scenes are deliberately cruel and it seems they are almost forced into the show.I stopped watching it after the birth scene. What was the need for that scene to last so long?A woman is litterally cut in half whilst she screams and the camera caught every details.To be fair many other scenes are disturbing and distracting from a plot, generally weak.I found weird that the reviews are actually so high for a show with no plot but violence scenes and some porn scenes.Unfortunately it wasn't enjoyable to watch there could have been so many stories to tell about a young Daenerys."
"I know people who have read all the GOT books and never watched the TV show and vica versa.I haven't read the books but enjoyed the GOT show, despite a rushed ending.I've just watched the 1st episode of HOD and thought it was an ok start and will watch more and stick with it, perhaps.The sets are more of the same, the soundtrack familiar which I like but this time round I'm finding myself looking for Easter eggs and references to GOT, purely because I got confused with all the different families and how they relate to the story first time round. Which isn't a bad thing but perhaps takes a bit of the enjoyment of it.It's Marmite, you'll love it or hate it. It's all fiction so don't let it bother you."
"Production value is great and a lot of talented people stood up what we have seen for first half of the season. But the things wrong are all the things wrong with the last few scenes of GOT with none of the intrigue. A rushed yet drab plot, boring scenes, anything graphic feels affected (violence, sex, etc) and flat characters whose names all start with R and sound the same - don't get me started in why we had to have two actors for young and old roles with not much aging between the two. I really want to like this show and I will probably watch a few more episodes but may give up and face terms with the fact that GOT is over and it's time for something new."
"Gave it a chance, but this universe is obsessed with torture. I am starting to think it was not the original show runners, but Martin's universe which is just violence porn with a layer of awful politics so that people can pretend they are learning ""how the world works"" while satisfying some deep primal urge of violence.That said, the sets are very well done, and I think the actors all do a good job. It's the content of the universe that I just have no faith in at this point and I expect this review to do nothing because people desperately want content, and this fills that void and others. But I just find it very formulaic."
"Ok, the first few episodes were intriguing, but around episode 5 and definitely episodes 6 and 7 it just entirely falls apart. I really wanted to like this show, but I'll list all the reasons I just can't bear any more of it. First of all, there are major gaps in the plot line, like killing someone with a horse without actually showing how you made the horse kill somebody. Secondly, switching out the main actress was an absolutely terrible idea, unless it was her or her agent's idea, in which case I'm glad they left. She was the show, and once she was gone there was nothing redeeming left. Episode 6 is literally pitch black like they forgot to turn the master brightness up from 5%, did anyone ever actually watch it before it was released? The wigs are absolutely ridiculous and it makes no sense that people with dark skin wearing awful wigs would be living on a cloudy coastline and have such dark skin, nor how mixing genetics randomly gets you children will fully dark skin again. Nothing in this show has any purpose, meaning, or sense about it, it's just aimless drama where a bunch of cheap scenes are filmed with people talking about their heritage or how its suddenly the end of the world, when in reality there is actually nothing wrong with the world, and their sibling is actually a completely different actor or just didn't age nearly as much as the ones who didn't get replaced. Seriously, this show turned out to be awful. I don't understand how they can do such a poor job and get away with it. Everyone in episode 6 should be fired for the lighting, absolutely F quality material and with such a high budget its an absolute immoral shame."
Worse Acting. Nothing comparable to GOT. Might improve with more episodes. Script is horrible. Only thing that resembles from GOT are the pornography scenes.
"I mean come in here, I felt asleep episode 2! Where is the trilled? Where is the politics? Who wrote this? Let's not even start with the boring text and the non charismatic casts...there is absolutely no excitement to watch this and if any true fans of GOT watches this will laugh and turn on the new lord of the rings of power.I mean come in here, I felt asleep episode 2!

"It was a bit slow to start but by episode 5 it was really starting to get good especially withy he actors.....however, come episode 6, 10years had lapsed, new actors that had aged years more then those not replaced and had gotten much less attractive and with much less acting talent just reunited the show after investing much into those actors and their portrayal"
"It is really a massive disappointment and disservice to the series to make such a forced blunder that cannot be undone with these new bad actors, massive failure.But who knows? Maybe there will be a complete 180 or something even more with actual good scripts and writing and storytelling without changing actors actually getting some storytelling good done."
"The House of the Dragons. Is a good start to a what can be a Incredible Show. For what I would do if I was a Producer/filmmaker.I would continue making episodes until the time period of The Game of Thrones time period. Then remake/redo The Game of Thrones series.Then I would make another series called ""West of Westerrous"" staring Aerria Stark. Because in the last season of The Game of Thrones. Season 8 episode 6. Aerria Stark tells John Snow she was going to explore what ever West of Westerrous and from there the Producers/Writers can continue with either the same story line as The Game of Thrones or make a new story line starring Aerria Stark (the girl who played Aerria Stark)"
"I loved GOT and would rate that a 10 but HOD is a 4. Honestly, I struggled getting through season one. It is boring and slow paced with a few special effects of dragons. I went back today and watched the pilot for GOT and was blown away by it. Honestly, if they do not change this to by more like GOT, I will not watch season 2. I really do not under stand the high score for this show. I went back today and watched the pilot for GOT and was blown away by it.

I was happy to read that we geg a prelude to GOT.After now few episodes I am sad to say the script leaves lot's to desire.The cast is amazing the look is fantastic but the sadessed thing is that it's doesn't seem to fit.The story is thin but maybe it bulits to something as is it. But maybe I am just afraid that in the end the bubble bursts and it ends like the last one did.But as I said great cast great look but very long conversations without end and not much action.The song of ice and fire.I lobe the whole story read the books and the imagination is a strong story teller.But bottom line I love it and sad to see that the whole is set up to end I a bog fight as it always does.
"I just hope its going to be better, becouse the starting episode is booooooring. At the moment nothing is interesting here, its like just continued the last two got season, which was painfully bad. Im hope its turning to be better.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------600 caracter now. Maybe........."
"I really wanted to like it cause I adored GOT. But unlike GOT, there's not a single character that I found myself rooting for. And the ones that I did like ended up either dying or doing deplorable things. With GOT, I instantly loved Ned and Catlyn Stark. Especially Catlyn Stark. I'm a mom. She was a mom. And I loved her. With HOTD, I was excited to see Rys (not sure what his last name is) as the hand to the king. I loved Rys from the Replacements and Notting Hill. But he sold his daughter off to the king like she was a piece of meat. I also liked the Queen. But she was killed off by her own husband. I liked the princess's best friend but she ends up hooking up with her friend's dad. I liked the princess because she reminded me of Arya but she adores her piece of poop uncle and I don't like that at all. All of the characters I wanted to like either died or ended up being pieces of poop. Unlike GOT, where there were tons of awesome characters to root for who weren't pieces of poop. All in all, I didn't really like it. Even though I wanted to."
"The king meets with Corlys in the throne room of High Tide, the seat of House Valeryon, to talk marriage and politics-which, in this case, are one in the same. On the surface, the idea is a win-win-win: The king can win back House Valeryon as an ally; Rhaenyra can divert attention away from her sex scandal with Daemon; and the Sea Snake can secure his family a place in the royal dynasty.After a brief negotiation, the wedding is officially on. But afterwards, alone with her husband, Princess Rhaenys (we missed you, girl! And we love your pants!) expresses her doubts: Making Laenor the future king consort to a controversial heiress will put him in the path of considerable danger. And then there's the other issue: Even if Corlys refuses to acknowledge it, Rhaenys knows full well that her son is gay. Luckily, Rhaenyra knows too-and she's got a proposition that will benefit them both. They'll ""do their duty"" and pop out a few heirs, sure; but aside from that, they can bed whomever they want. And given the circumstances of their lives, this plan doesn't sound half bad.Please visit my website link in bio."
In the additional clips about the show the production team says how they used candles to light the indoor scenes to give it authenticity.Big mistake. The lighting really spoils the whole production. Dull & horrible.Hope they dont make the same mistake for series 2.Apart from the lighting it's brilliant.The acting is excellent. Story is good in that it puts the original series in perspective.It's a bit of a suprise when in episode 5 they swap just two of the main actors to older people but leave everyone else unchanged.I'm watching it now & it is just so annoying that the lighting is so bad. You cant even easily see facial expressions unless the character is close up & centre screen.
"Honestly, can we just get a movie/show that doesn't want to push some LGBTQ or ""woman's right"" propaganda down our throat?Episode 4 is all about ""why men get to have premarital relations and it's not shameful, but when a woman does it, it's shameful"" or ""i want to be a strong woman and don't want to just sit at home and squeeze out babies"". It's funny because women have literally more rights in most western societies like America and Canada, and yet these shows are pushing ""equality"" bs down young men's throats and making men feel like they're doing something wrong.Dont even get me started with the episode 5. Why does there have to be a gay character in every movie? I respect gay people and lgbtq community, but please STOP this madness. Some may say ""oh because we want to make them feel included in our society"" . Well, there are waaayyyyyyyy more Asians, latinos, middle easterns people than gays in our society that never get to feel ""included"" when watching these movies or shows.STOP BRAINWASHING PEOPLE."
